# SwePubDataGameProject
During 2014 we have carried out put a project with the goal to create game concepts and games based on a set of data about research publication, methods for procedural content generation in games, usage of open data and means of creating useful games and game concepts for actual users. The project was funded by the National Library of Sweden, a project which aimed at exploring possibilities to create a computer game based on publication metadata. The project Gamification of Publication Metadata : To Playfully Explore Our Data ran January-December 2014.
