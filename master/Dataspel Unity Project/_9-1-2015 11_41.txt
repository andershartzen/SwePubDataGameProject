Two different carrier gases are tested. At 600?degrees C, using argon as the carrier gas, the deposition rate is close to 1?mu m h-1. The film has a density of 2.14?g?cm-3 with a B/C ratio of 3.7. When hydrogen is used as the carrier gas, the film density is 2.42?g?cm-3, the B/C ratio 4.6, and the deposition rate 0.35?mu m h-1. The hydrogen content in the films is about 34 at.-%, regardless of ambient conditions during deposition, and varies only with the deposition temperature. In addition, both the film composition and the film density are found to vary significantly with the deposition temperature and the atmospheric conditions. Based upon these results, a deposition mechanism for the growth of boron-carbon films from TEB, where the TEB molecule is decomposed to BH3 and hydrocarbons, is suggested." | GameTime: 6.840593 sec |

It was possible to identify P at the Si cubic site as the shallower donor with ionization energy of 60.7meV, as well as to distinguish the contribution in the spectrum from pairs involving this donor and Al acceptors from both the cubic and hexagonal lattice sites, leading to justification of their ionization energies. The case of N-Al pair luminescence was revisited and the ionization energy of the deeper Nc donor at the cubic site was determined, 125.5meV. © 2005 The American Physical Society." | GameTime: 14.62719 sec |
