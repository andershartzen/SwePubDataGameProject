In this paper we explore different approaches and new constructs for improved dimensional inference and unit consistency checking in Modelica; both from an end-user, library, and tool perspective. A proposal for how dimensional inference and unit checking can be carried out is outlined and a prototype implementation is developed and verified using several examples from the Modelica standard library." | GameTime: 11.18797 sec |
