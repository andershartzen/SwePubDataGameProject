We present research results in various media, where everyone can read about the life circumstances of a particular group or persons, and as professionals we intend to interpret people’s life situations for the purpose of rehabilitation plans, teaching activities, etc. The question we will address concerns the trustworthiness in understanding another person’s life. For instance, in the tradition of life-world phenomenological research, how is it possible to understand another person’s world? And, to make it even more difficult; how is it possible to understand the world of a person with functional or activity limitations, in this case a person who is blind? Within a life-world approach, this question is imperative. What are the possibilities, but also difficulties or limitations, in trying to understand a blind and a sighted person’s world respectively? From interpretative standpoint it is of great importance to find usable concepts in the ‘research communication arena’, but also to penetrate the perceptual ground for the language used. To answer these questions qualitative research is the preferred strategy to approach O&M practice, for instance when introducing new environments and orientation activities. In the presentation we will address these questions from the perspective of the researcher and the professional, but also from the perspective of our own experiences of blindness and normal vision. Here we will use our own experiences in trying to understand the world of blindness and sightness respectively." | GameTime: 22.84892 sec |

The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five-step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre’s focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one’s own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one’s own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body." | GameTime: 45.29944 sec |

| New Puzzle Opened - Titles: 0= "Historien som fiktion" 1= "Toddler interaction during play in the Swedish preschool" 2= "Small-x phenomenology - Summary of the 3rd Lund small-x workshop in 2004" 3= "Phenomenology of Eros"  - Solution = "Historien som fiktion" - Abstract: "The present study explores the reception of historical feature films in history education. It is concerned with how pupils experience the films as well as the significance of the feature film for their understanding and interpretation of history. The study incorporates empirical data from classroom projects in two different Swedish upper secondary schools where film was used as an educational tool. Observations of classroom activities were made and interviews with twelve pupils and their history teachers were conducted.The study applies a phenomenological approach. The lifeworld of the pupils is in focus, specifically the aspect of the lifeworld they live and experience in history class when film is used as a means of understanding the past. The phenomenon studied is thus how the pupils experience the film, and through the film, history itself. Theoretical notions from film reception studies and history didactics are used as analytic tools.The study shows how emotional and cognitive processes converge in the pupils’ meaning making of the films. The embodiment of the films’ narrative is an important factor that contributes to both the understanding of the film as well as of history. The pupils experience the films emotionally, feeling both empathy and antipathy for the various characters, physically through sight and sound as well as embodied reactions, and cognitively through an understanding of the film’s narrative. Embodied experience is fundamental for history to become materialized. The audiovisual portrayal and materialization of the past becomes embodied in the pupils so that the experience of the film and of the historical lifeworld presented therein becomes part of their lifeworld. Generally, pupils consider the films to be trustworthy, though this perceived accuracy depends on how authentically the narrative is performed and the pupils’ previous store of historical knowledge. A didactic dilemma to consider when using historical feature film in the classroom is the contradiction between the aesthetic experience of a feature film and its use as a tool for understanding the past. The captivating character of feature film evokes empathy and engagement with the films’ characters regardless of the degree of historical accuracy. This is a critical issue for teachers; there needs to be balance between respect for the pupils’ aesthetic experience of the film and the need to guide them to develop for example the skills of historical empathy, where distance is necessary for the pupils to be able to consider different perspectives." | GameTime: 56.36868 sec |
