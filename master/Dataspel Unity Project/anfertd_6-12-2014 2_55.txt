The algorithm includes pre-simulated Monte Carlo data for a range of physiologically relevant epidermal thicknesses and tissue scattering levels. The simulated photon pathlength distributions in each layer are stored and the absorption effect from tissue chromophores added in the post-processing. Recorded DRS spectra at source-detector distances of 0.4 and 1.2 mm were calibrated for the relative intensity between the two distances and matched to simulated spectra in a non-linear optimization algorithm. This study evaluates the DRS spectral fitting accuracy and presents data on the main output parameters; the tissue fraction of red blood cells and local oxygenation (SO2). As a reference, the microcirculatory perfusion (Perf) was measured simultaneously in the same probe using laser Doppler Flowmetry. Data were recorded on the volar forearm of three healthy subjects in a protocol involving a 5 min systolic occlusion. The DRS spectra were modeled with an rms-error &lt; 2%. In two subjects, SO2 decreased during occlusion to &lt;10%, and increased to above baseline after hyperemia, while Perf increased &gt;7 times compared to baseline. In the third subject the SO2 decreased less during occlusion and increased to baseline values at hyperemia with only a 2-fold increase in Perf. The observed difference could be due to different microvascular beds being probed. It is concluded that integrating DRS and LDF enables new possibilities to deduce microcirculation status." | GameTime: 9.129232 sec |

A natural course of development of these systems is to incorporate patient specific anatomical models. This step requires some kind of segmentation process in which the different anatomical parts are extracted. Anatomical datasets are, however, usually very large and manual processing would be too demanding. Hence, automatic, or semi-automatic, methods to handle this step are required. The framework presented in this paper uses nonrigid registration, based on the morphon method, to automatically segment the hip anatomy and generate models for a hip surgery simulator system." | GameTime: 22.31394 sec |
