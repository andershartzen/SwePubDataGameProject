There is a presumed role for prophylaxis with VWF-containing concentrates_ but data are scarce. The von Willebrand Disease Prophylaxis Network (VWD PN) was formed to investigate the role of prophylaxis in clinically severe VWD that is not responsive to other treatment(s). Using a retrospective design_ the effect of prophylaxis was studied. Availability of records to document_ or reliably assess_ the type and frequency of bleeding episodes prior to_ and after_ the initiation of prophylaxis was required. Annualized bleeding rates were calculated for the period prior to prophylaxis_ during prophylaxis and by primary bleeding indication defined as the site accounting for more than half of all bleeding symptoms. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test of differences in the medians was used. Sixty-one subjects from 20 centres in 10 countries were enrolled. Data for 59 were used in the analysis. The median age at onset of prophylaxis was 22.4 years. Type 3 VWD accounted for the largest number (N = 34_ 57.6%). Differences in bleeding rates within individuals during compared with before prophylaxis were significant for the total group (P &lt; 0.0001)_ and for those with primary bleeding indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005)_ joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The effect of prophylaxis was similar among those age &lt; 18 years and those &gt;= 18. One person developed an inhibitor during treatment. We conclude that prophylactic treatment of VWD is efficacious.","Prophylaxis in severe forms of von Willebrand's disease: results from the von Willebrand Disease Prophylaxis Network (VWD PN)"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_40877_7","Eicosanoids include prostaglandins_ thromboxanes and leukotrienes_ which are arachidonic acid oxygenation products. These lipids make important contributions to the signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases. The level of free arachidonic acid seems to be a rate-limiting factor in the synthesis of eicosanoids and the enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) has been shown to preferentially liberate arachidonic acid from phospholipids in the cell membranes of macrophages. Stimulation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with Prevotella intermedia_ a bacterium involved in periodontitis_ led to activation of cPLA2 and release of arachidonate. The use of the inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) kinase (PD 98059) and p38 (SB 203580) revealed that both the MAP kinases ERK-1/2 and p38 were regulating the bacteria- or zymosan-induced activation of cPLA2. Another kinase_ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) was found to be involved in the activation of ERK-1/2 and p38 and thereby also in the activation of cPLA2 and the subsequent release of arachidonate. However_ lipopolysaccharide induced a PtdIns 3-kinase-independent activation of cPLA2. Pretreatment of the cells with an inhibitor of PtdIns 3-kinase (wortmannin) decreased the zymosan-induced translocation of phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) to the cytoskeleton. Both zymosan and bacteria stimulation induced a tyrosine phosphoprylation of PLC-gamma2. In contrast_ stimulation with LPS failed to induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (dex) was found to reduce the mRNA expression and activation of cPLA2 The effects of dex on cPLA2 activation were not exerted to any major extent at the MAP kinase level. In conclusion_ bacteria- and zymosan-induced signalling to activation of cPLA2 and release of arachidonate is mediated via PtdIns 3-kinase_ ERK-1/2 and p38.","Signalling to Activation of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 and Arachidonate Release in Macrophages"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_40877_7","Summary in swedish I en rad olika inflammatoriska sjukdomar såsom astma_ reumatoid artrit och parodontit är makrofager involverade. Makrofager är vita blodkroppar som finns i kroppens olika vävnader. De reagerar på främmande partiklar_ t ex bakterier_ och bekämpar dessa genom att ”dels äta upp” främmande partiklar_ sk fagocytos_ och dels genom att utsöndra olika substanser såsom prostaglandiner och leukotriener. Dessa bildas från fettsyran arakidonsyra och är viktiga proinflammatoriska ämnen. Prostaglandiner och leukotriener finns normalt i låg koncentration i vävnaden och kan där ha en skyddande mekanism. Vid en inflammation kan koncentrationen av dessa substanser öka okontrollerat och bidraga till kroniska inflammationer. Frisättningen av arakidonsyra från cellmembranen utförs av enzymet fosfolipas A2 (cPLA2). Denna reaktion utgör det initiala och hastighetsreglerande steget i bildandet av prostaglandiner och leukotriener. Det är därför av stort intresse att klargöra vilka mekanismer som reglerar aktiviteten av cPLA2. Syftet med arbetet har varit att klarlägga de signaleringsmekanismer som aktiveras inuti makrofagen och leder till aktivering av cPLA2 och frisättning av arakidonsyra. Bakterier involverade i tandlossning har bl a använts som stimuli. Vi fann att bakterier aktiverar två sk proteinkinaser_ ERK och p38_ vilka i sin tur reglerar aktiviteten av cPLA2 och frisättningen av arakidonsyra. Vidare fann vi att den inflammationsdämpande substansen dexametason inte hämmar aktiveringen av ERK och p38 men däremot hämmar bildningen av proteinet cPLA2. Förutom att aktiveras (fosforyleras) av proteinkinaser behöver cPLA2 en ökning av den intracellulära kalciumkoncentrationen för att kunna frisätta arakidonsyra från cellmembranet. Enzymet fosfolipas C (PLC) reglerar calciumkoncentrationen i cellen. En viss forma av detta enzym_ PLC-gamma2_ aktiveras av lipidkinaset fosfatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinas) vilket leder till att PLC-gamma2 byter lokalisation inuti makrofagen. Vi fann vidare att PtdIns 3-kinas på ett stimuliberoende sätt reglerar aktiveringen av ERK och p38. Detta medför att PtdIns 3-kinas indirekt reglerar aktiveringen av cPLA2 och frisättningen av arakidonsyra i makrofager. Sammanfattningsvis så leder denna kunskap till en bättre förståelse för hur bakterier orsakar inflammation och kan därmed på sikt få betydelse för utvecklingen av nya behandlingsmetoder.","Signalling to Activation of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 and Arachidonate Release in Macrophages"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_4391130_7","The present thesis investigates the usage of cultural heritage resources on the web. In recent years cultural heritage objects has been digitalized and made available on the web for the general public to use. The thesis addresses to what extent the digitalized material is used_ and how findable it is on the web. On the web resources needs to be findable in order to be visited and used. The study is done at the intersection of several research areas in Library and Information Science; Information Seeking/Human Information Behaviour_ Interactive Information Retrieval_ and Webometrics. The two thesis research questions focus on different aspects of the study: (1) findability on the web; and (2) the usage and the users. The usage of the cultural heritage is analysed with Savolainen’s Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS) framework. The IS&amp;R framework by Ingwersen and Järvelin is the main theoretical foundation_ and a conceptual framework is developed so the examined aspects could be related to each other more clearly. An important distinction in the framework is between object and resource. An object is a single document_ file or html page_ whereas a resource is a collection of objects_ e.g. a cultural heritage web site. Three webometric levels are used to both combine and distinguish the data types: usage_ content_ and structure. The interaction between the system and its users’ information search process was divided into query dependent and query independent aspects. The query dependent aspects contain the information need on the user side and the topic of the content on the system side. The query independent aspects are the structural findability on the system side and the users search skills on the user side. The conceptual framework is summarised in the User-Resource Interaction (URI) model. The research design is a methodological triangulation_ in the form of a mixed methods approach in order to obtain measures and indicators of the resources and the usage from different angels. Four methods are used: site structure analysis; log analysis; web survey; and findability analysis. The research design is both sequential and parallel_ the site structure analysis preceded the log analysis and the findability analysis_ and the web survey was employed independent of the other methods. Three Danish resources are studied: Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur (ADL)_ a collection of literary texts written by authors; Kunst Index Danmark (KID)_ an index of the holdings in the Danish art museums; and Guaman Poma Inch Chronicle (Poma)_ a digitalized manuscript on the UNESCO list of World cultural heritage. The studied log covers all usage during the period October to December 2010. The site structure is analysed so the resources can be described as different levels_ based on function and content. The results from the site structure analysis are used both in the log analysis and the findability analysis_ as well as a way to describe the resources. In the log analysis navigation strategies and navigation patterns are studied. Navigation through a web search engine is the most common way to reach the resources_ but both direct navigation and link navigation are also used in all three resources. Most users arrive in the middle level in ADL and KID_ at information on authors and artists. On average cultural heritage objects are viewed in half of the session. In the analysis of the web survey answers two groups of users’ are distinguished_ the professional user in a work context and users in a hobby or leisure context. School or study as a context is prominent in Guaman Poma_ the Inca Chronicle. Generally are pages about the cultural heritage more frequently visited than the digitized cultural heritage objects. In the findability framework six aspects are identified as central for the findability of an object on the web: attributes of the object_ accessibility_ internal navigation_ internal search_ reachability and web prestige. The six aspects are evaluated through seven indicators. All studied objects are findable in the analysis using the findability framework. A findability issue in KID is the use of the secure https protocol instead of http_ which leads to the objects in KID having no PageRank value in Google and thereby a lower ranking in comparison to similar objects with a PageRank value. The internal findability is reduced for the objects in top of all three resources_ e.g. the first page_ due to the focus of the internal search engine on the cultural heritage objects. Several possible adjustment or developments of the findability frameworks is discussed_ such as changing the weightning between the aspects measured_ alternative scores and automated measuring. In conclusion_ the investigation adds to our knowledge about how resources with digitalized cultural heritage are accessed and used_ as well as how findable they are. The thesis provides both theoretical and conceptual contributions to research. The IS&amp;R framework has been adapted to the web_ the information search process was split into query dependent and query independent aspects_ and a whole findability framework has been developed. Both the empirical findings and the theoretical advancements support the development of better access to web resources.","Navigation_ findability and the usage of cultural heritage on the web: an exploratory study"

Four separate listening tests were carried out with four different sets of stimuli: 10 and 3 seconds of spontaneous speech_ one isolated word_ and 6 concatenated isolated words_ all produced by the same 24 speakers. The results showed that the listeners&#39; judgements were about twice as accurate compared to a baseline estimator_ and that both stimulus duration and type affected the judgements. It was also found that stimulus duration influenced the listeners judgements of female speakers somewhat more_ while stimulus type affected the age judgments of male speakers more_ indicating that listeners may use different strategies when judging female and male speaker age.","Stimulus duration and type in perception of female and male speaker age"

A number of methods for repair and/or strengthening of concrete structures have been used over the years_ but very recently the use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate bonding has gained acceptance. The technique was originally developed with steel plates being bonded with an epoxy adhesive to a concrete structure_ but lately advances have been made in use of more suitable plate materials such as CFRP composites. This paper presents a pilot study of lab tests for concrete beams strengthened with prestressed near surface mounted CFRP laminates. Primary results indicate an increased strengthening effect when the steel reinforcement yielded and an increased cracking load_ but the ultimate load is the same as a beam strengthened without prestress. Failure modes were the same with or without prestress_ failure in the fiber_ but the prestressed beams had smaller deflections at failure.","Concrete beams strengthened with prestressed near surface mounted reinforcement (NSFR)"

As there has been no agreement on which MDBGN test preparation to use_ a study was initiated to help determine the optimal patch test preparation for MDBGN. 2661 consecutively patch tested patients at 11 test clinics representing 9 European countries participated. Petrolatum preparations with MDBGN at 1.0%_ 0.5%_ 0.3% and 0.1% were inserted in the standard series. Contact allergy rates were noted in the range 4.4-1.1% following decreasing test concentrations. Reactions not fulfilling all criteria to be classified as allergic reactions could represent either weak allergic or irritant reactions_ and such reactions were noted in the range 8.2-0.5% with decreasing concentrations. A significant number of these reactions represented weak allergic reactions_ as allergic reactions were obtained to higher patch test concentrations in the same individual. Morphologically irritant reactions were noted only for the highest test concentrations. In summary_ the contact allergy rates and frequencies of doubtful and irritant reactions vary with the patch test concentration. The final decision on patch test concentration for MDBGN should not only rely on these factors but also include information on patch test concentrations required to diagnose individual cases with allergic contact dermatitis from MDBGN as well as results of repeated open application tests.","Patch testing with methyldibromo glutaronitrile_ a multicentre study within the EECDRG"

"oai_pure_atira_dk_publications9ff3d500bea511db834c000ea68e967b_7","Världen över bedrivs det omfattande forskning på inomhusmiljö och luftkvalitet. Trots det finns det fortfarande ingen metod för att bestämma sannolikheten för att någon form av definierad skada inträffar på inomhusmiljön med konsekvenser för människors hälsa på samma sätt som det finns metoder i moderna konstruktionsregler för att bestämma risken för mekanisk påverkan på byggnadskonstruktioner. Förekomsten av en sådan metod skulle vara ett viktigt instrument för miljöbeslut i alla led i byggprocessen. En metod har utvecklats i denna licentiatuppsats för att bestämma risken för att höga koncentrationer av radon skall förekomma i inomhusluften. Metoden har tagits fram genom att tillämpa riskanalys på en platta på mark som är en vanlig handläggningsmetod för bostadshus i Sverige. Orsakerna till den oönskade händelsen "Läckage av radon in i byggnaden" har kunnat härledas med hjälp av felträdsanalys genom att starta i toppen av trädet och arbeta sig nedåt. Proceduren upprepas tills primärhändelser erhålls för vilka sannolikheter kan bestämmas. Felträdsanalys är en deduktiv metod som är utvecklad för system som är uppbyggda av elektroniska komponenter och för vilka sannolikheter för fel i form av relativa frekvenser är enkla att bestämma. Det är svårare att bestämma sannolikheter för fel i byggprocessen eftersom varje objekt oftast är unikt. Denna osäkerhet kan dock hanteras genom att använda samma säkerhetsfilosofiska modell som används för mekanisk påverkan på bärande konstruktioner där hänsyn kan tas till flera stokastiska variabler i samma analys vilket gör det möjligt att ersätta en hel gren i ett felträd. För att hantera osäkerheter används den säkerhetsfilosofiska modellen för bärande konstruktioner sannolikhetsteori och för att bestämma risken kan Monte Carlosimuleringar och 'första ordningens nivå 2'-metod användas. För att få en ohälsosam inomhusmiljö behövs miljöpåverkan tillsammans med ett fel i byggnaden orsakat i något led av byggprocessen. Exempel på fel som kan medföra en ohälsosam inomhusmiljö är attbyggherren ändrar eller gör kompletteringar i byggnaden_ konstruktionen är olämpligt utförd eller att materialleveranser är felaktiga. Flera undersökningar har kommit fram till att t.ex. bristande engagemang eller bristande kunskap många gånger är orsakerna till de fel som uppkommer i byggprocessen. Bristande kunskap kan också bero på att kunskapen inte finns_ dvs byggnaden utförs på ett riktigt sätt med avseende på den kunskap som finns. Fel kan aldrig elimineras helt men användandet av felträdsanalys för att ta fram orsakerna till en ohälsosam inomhusmiljö och bestämmandet av risken skulle kunna vara ett värdefullt verktyg i kvalitetssystem för att få en överblick över hela byggprocessen och för att kunna identifiera de svaga länkarna. Bostadshuset som exemplifieras i den här uppsatsen är beläget utanför Linköping eftersom det där har förekommit långtidsmätningar på radonhalten i marken. Byggnaden ventileras genom självdrag och grundplattans konstruktion består_ med start från schaktbotten_ av en geotextil_ 150 mm vältvättad makadam_ 50 mm isolering_ 100 mm armerad betong_ avjämningsmassa samt golvbeläggning. Orsakerna till radonkoncentrationer inomhus har bestämts genom felträdsanalys och består av "Läckage av radonhaltig jordluft"_ "Radonhaltigt dricksvatten" och "Byggnadsmaterialet innehåller radium som sönderfaller till radon". Den huvudsakliga orsaken till radon i inomhusluften är "Läckage av radonhaltig jordluft" och den utvecklas därför vidare och orsakas av "Lägre lufttryck inomhus än utomhus"_ "Jordluften under eller runt byggnaden innehåller radon" och "Fel i byggnadsdelen med hänsyn till lufttäthet". En funktion som beskriver förhållandet mellan de olika primärhändelserna och dess stokastiska variabler har tagits fram och genom att använda både Monte Carlo-simulering och första ordningens nivå 2-metod har sannolikheten samt säkerhetsindex β bestämts för att den oönskade händelsen skall inträffa. Hänsyn har bara tagits till läckage av radonhaltig jordluft genom sprickor i betongplattan och det har varit svårt att hitta lämpliga förhållanden mellan hur sprickor uppkommer_ sprickvidd och betongens och armeringens egenskaper. Därför har antaganden gjorts i vissa fall. För normalriskmark_ som 70 % av Sveriges yta består av_ har simuleringarna och beräkningarna givit ett säkerhetsindex β = 0.30 för bostadshus där människor uppehåller sig mer än tillfälligt. En jämförelse kan göras med de svenska konstruktionsreglerna där bärande konstruktioner i ett bostadshus skall uppfylla säkerhetsklass 2 med ett säkerhetsindex β ≥ 4.3 för att ett bostadshus_ byggt på normalriskmark med en platta på mark enligt denna uppsats_ skall innehålla radonkoncentrationer över det svenska normgränsvärdet 200 Bq/m3_ är alltså mer än 40.000 gånger större än risken för att den bärande konstruktionen inte skall hålla.","Probabilistic design for evaluation of indoor environment"
"oai_pure_atira_dk_publications9ff3d500bea511db834c000ea68e967b_7","In recent years indoor environment and indoor air quality has been subjected to extensive worldwide research efforts. Still_ at present there are a lack of methods for prediction of risks and consequences for any defined damage to occur_ similar to the probabilistic methods used in modern design codes for structures and buildings. Such a method_ if available and usable_ could be very beneficial as a tool for decision making at different stages of the building process. In this licentiate thesis a method is developed to estimate the risk of occurrence of high radon concentrations indoors. The method is developed using risk analysis applied on a concrete slab on the ground_ which is a foundation method commonly used in Sweden for residential buildings. The undesirable event is "Leakage of radon into the building" and fault tree analysis is used starting in the top with the undesirable event and then working downwards finding the events_ which causes the top event. This procedure continues until basic events areestablished and for which failure probabilities are available. Fault tree analysis is a deductive method mainly used for systems built up with electronic equipment where failure probabilities in terms of relative frequency are easy to establish. Failure probabilities are more difficult to establish in the building process since failures are rare. However_ this uncertainty can be handled by applying structural reliability analysis on the quantitative analysis whereas several random variables can be taken into account in a single analysis_ which makes it possible to analyse a whole branch of a fault tree in a single analysis. The basis for structural reliability methods is probability theory to handle the uncertainties and Monte Carlo simulation and first-order second-moment theory to estimate the risk. To get an indoor environment that is unhealthy to human beings environmental impact is needed together with fault due to human error in some phase of the building process. Examples of faults made in the building process are changes and/or addition of work ordered by the proprietor_ unsuitable design or delivery of wrong material to the construction site. Several surveys have come to the same conclusion that a large amount of faults made in the building process depends on e.g. insufficient commitment or lack of knowledge. However_ the building could be designed and constructed according to the state-of-the art of knowledge and still has an improper function. Errors cannot be ruled out completely but the use of fault tree technique to develop the causes to an unhealthy indoor environment and the estimation of risk can be a valuable communication tool to the quality management system to get an overview of the entire building process and to identify the week links. The residential building used as an example in this work is situated outside the municipality of Linköping since long-term measurements of radon concentrations in soil air are available from this area. The building has a self-draught ventilation system and the design of the concrete slab_ starting from the excavated rock floor_ include a geotextile_ 150 mm well washed macadam_ 50 mm insulation_ 100 mm reinforced concrete_ a levelling compound and finally a flooring. The causes to radon concentrations indoor has been developed with fault tree analysis where "Leakage of radon contaminated soil air into the building"_ "Radon contaminated drinking water" and "Building material contains radium disintegrating to radon" constitute the main causes. The event "Leakage of radon contaminated soil air...." is developed further_ since it is the major contributor to radon concentrations indoor_ into the events "Lower air pressure indoor than outdoor"_ "Radon contaminated soil air under or around the building" and "Fault in component with regard to air-tightness". A function expressing the relationship between the basic events and their random variables is established and both Monte Carlo simulation and first-order second-moment theory is applied to estimate the probability and the safety index b for the undesirable event to occur. The leakage of radon-contaminated soil air has only been considered through fissures in the concrete slab and it has been difficult to find proper relationships between how fissures occur_ fissure width_ and concrete and reinforcement properties. Approximations have therefore become necessary. However_ the simulation and the analytical calculation gives e.g. safety index beta = 0.30 on normal risk area_ which is 70 % of the total area of Sweden_ in residential buildings where people stay more than temporary. Comparison can be made with the safety index beta larger or equal to 4.3 for safety class 2 in the Swedish Design Regulations for the structure of residential buildings. In a residential building on normal risk area and designed in accordance with the concrete slab in this work_ the probability for radon concentrations indoor to exceed the Swedish Building Regulations threshold value 200 Bq/m3 is over 40.000 times larger than the risk for structural failure.","Probabilistic design for evaluation of indoor environment"

"oai_services_scigloo_org_1404_7","A linear Euler method for analysing unsteady inviscid compressible quasi three- dimensional flows in oscillating cascades is developed. It is applicable to both blade flutter and forced response problems. The method considers linear time harmonic perturbations on a steady solution to the nonlinear Euler equations and it has the potential of becoming a computationally very efficient method. The perturbation flow is governed by the linearized Euler equations_ which are linear differential equations whose coefficients depend on the steady flow field. To calculate the steady flow field an explicit flow solver_ VOLFAP_ is used. A grid generator based on the advancing front technique is coupled to the flow solver to provide for solution-adaptive remeshing. The idea of remeshing is especially useful for problems involving shocks_ since shocks of any shape can be resolved as accurately as wanted. To discretize and solve the linear Euler equations a pseudo-time time marching Lax- Wendroff scheme is used. The last mesh used in the steady flow analysis is used in the linear unsteady analysis. The mesh is harmonically deformed for problems involving vibrating blades_ flutter. Forced response problems are treated by prescribing incoming waves in the nonreflecting boundary conditions. Results for different standard configurations are presented for both flutter and forced response problems. Comparisons with other numerical methods show good agreement. A comparison between 1D and 2D nonreflecting boundary conditions show that spurious reflections from 1D boundary conditions can corrupt a solution severely even if the condition is not close to acoustic resonance. It is known that unsteady nonlinear solvers cannot effectively avoid spurious reflections from the boundaries. With the present method however_ one has complete control of such phenomena. In a transonic fan cascade study the present method is found to produce results_ for two cases_ which qualitatively agree well with results obtained by time-accurate Navier- Stokes simulations.","A Linearized Euler Method for Unsteady Flow in Axial-Flow Turbomachines"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_136095_7","Purpose – The aim of this study is to assess the role of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies in the reduction of CO2 emissions from European industries. Design/methodology/approach – A database covering all industrial installations included in the EU ETS has been created. Potential capture sources have been identified and the potential for CO2 capture has been estimated based on branch- and plant-specific conditions. Emphasis is placed here on three branches of industry with promising prospects for CCS: mineral oil refineries_ iron and steel_ and cement manufacturers. Findings – A relatively small number (~270) of large installations (>500_000?tCO2/year) dominates emissions from the three branches investigated in this study. Together these installations emit 432?MtCO2/year_ 8 percent of EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. If the full potential of emerging CO2 capture technologies was realized_ some 270-330?MtCO2 emissions could be avoided annually. Further_ several regions have been singled out as particularly suitable to facilitate integrated CO2 transport networks. The most promising prospects for an early deployment of CCS are found in the regions bordering the North Sea. Research limitations/implications – Replacement/retrofitting of the existing plant stock will involve large investments and deployment will take time. It is thus important to consider how the current industry structure influences the potential to reduce CO2 in the short- medium and long term. It is concluded that the age structure of the existing industry plant stock and its implications for the timing and deployment rate of CO2 capture and other mitigation measures are important and should therefore be further investigated. Practical implications – CCS has been recognized as a key option for reducing CO2 emissions within the EU. This assessment shows that considerable emission reductions could be achieved by targeting large point sources in some of the most emission-intensive industries. Yet_ a number of challenges need to be resolved in all parts of the CCS chain. Efforts need to be intensified from all stakeholders to gain more experience with the technological_ economical and social aspects of CCS. Originality/value – This study provides a first estimate of the potential role for CO2 capture technologies in lowering CO2 emissions from European heavy industry. By considering wider system aspects as well as plant-specific conditions the assessment made in this study gives a realistic overview of the prospects and practical limitations of CCS in EU industry.","Prospects for CO2 capture in European industry"

"oai_services_scigloo_org_189075_7","OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine whether isolated heart rate (HR) reduction with ivabradine reduces afterload of patients with systolic heart failure. BACKGROUND: The effective arterial elastance (Ea) represents resistive and pulsatile afterload of the heart derived from the pressure volume relation. HR modulates Ea_ and_ therefore_ afterload burden. METHODS: Among the patients with systolic heart failure (ejection fraction </=35%) randomized to either placebo or ivabradine in the SHIFT (Systolic Heart Failure Treatment With the If Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial)_ 275 patients (n = 132_ placebo; n = 143_ ivabradine 7.5 mg twice a day) were included in the echocardiographic substudy. Ea_ total arterial compliance (TAC)_ and end-systolic elastance (Ees) were calculated at baseline and after 8 months of treatment. Blood pressure was measured by arm cuff; stroke volume (SV)_ ejection fraction_ and end-diastolic volume were assessed by echocardiography. RESULTS: At baseline Ea_ TAC_ HR_ and Ees did not differ significantly between ivabradine- and placebo-treated patients. After 8 months of treatment_ HR was significantly reduced in the ivabradine group (p < 0.0001) and was accompanied by marked reduction in Ea (p < 0.0001) and improved TAC (p = 0.004) compared with placebo. Although contractility remained unchanged_ ventricular-arterial coupling was markedly improved (p = 0.002)_ resulting in a higher SV (p < 0.0001) in the ivabradine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated HR reduction by ivabradine improves TAC_ thus reducing Ea. Because Ees is unaltered_ improved ventricular-arterial coupling is responsible for increased SV. Therefore_ unloading of the heart may contribute to the beneficial effect of isolated HR reduction in patients with systolic heart failure.

We analyze both mere and only in terms of questions under discussion modeled as structures defined over sets of alternatives_ where the alternatives are non-standard in two respects. First_ as required by the analysis of mere_ there are free variables in the alternatives. Second_ the alternatives can be ranked by relations other than entailment; in this sense_ both mere and only are scalar both in their positive component ("at least X") and in their negative component ("at most X"). With evidence from negation_ reason clauses_ and emotive factive predicates_ we argue furthermore that the negative component of mere contributes to the at-issue meaning_ while the positive component is presupposed_ as has been previously argued for only. However_ mere and only differ in scope_ as evidenced by differences in interpretation and NPI licensing. Based on the NPI licensing properties of mere_ we argue that it has two uses_ one that attaches to properties and one that attaches to generalized quantifiers. The two uses are unified under one abstract lexical entry schema that can be extended to only as well. This schema can be seen as a first step towards establishing_ in general terms_ the core meaning for exclusives.","Mere-ology"

To investigate whether tailored evidence-based drug information (EBDI) to general practitioners (GPs) can change the proportion of ACE inhibitor prescriptions more effectively than EBDI provided as usual three and six months after the intervention. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. GPs in southern Sweden working at primary health care centres (PHCCs) in seven drug and therapeutic committee areas. Intervention. EBDI tailored to motivational interviewing (MI) technique and focused on the benefit aspect was compared with EBDI provided as usual. Subjects. There were 408 GPs in the intervention group and 583 GPs in the control group. Main outcome measures. Change in proportion of ACE inhibitor prescriptions relative to the sum of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers_ three and six months after the intervention. Results. The GPs’ average proportions of prescribed ACE inhibitors increased in both groups. No statistically significant differences in the change of proportions were found between intervention and control groups. Information was provided to 29% of GPs in both groups. Conclusion. This study could not prove that specially tailored EBDI using MI implements guidelines more effectively than EBDI provided as usual.

The overall aim of this thesis was to explore symptom experiences and self-care activities during radiotherapy. Further_ specifically in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy_ to investigate the correlation between fatigue and signs of intestinal injury and to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention aimed at alleviating fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. All studies comprised adults with cancer undergoing radiotherapy with focus on patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy in three out of four studies. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis was used through and within the studies. Grounded theory formed data collection and data analysis of the qualitative component in Paper I. The process of validating the Swedish version of the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale in Paper II included face validity_ internal consistency_ reliability and external and discriminative validity. Paper III and IV was performed on the basis that the development of fatigue rest upon a radiation-induced intestinal injury resulting in a cytokine induced inflammatory reaction_ which in turn may elicit fatigue. In Paper III associations between fatigue and intestinal injury were analyzed. Paper IV contains a quasi-experimental pilot study. All patients were allocated to an intervention based on bovine colostrum to be taken daily during radiotherapy with the intent to address the intestinal injury by strengthening the mucosal barrier. Feasibility was the primary variable together with data on symptoms_ intestinal injury and biomarkers for systemic inflammation. A historical comparison group (Paper III) was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention. The result showed that living through pelvic radiotherapy can be understood as a process to maintain self-identity. The experiences and self-initiated activities which formed this process were understood to comprise of focusing on symptoms_ getting cured and on self-image. Patients experienced several distressing symptoms comprised both situational and existential meaning. The validation of the Swedish version of the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale resulted in several modifications to the questionnaire. The internal consistency of the Swedish version of the questionnaire was different from that of the original version and the discriminative validity of the four subscales was not supported. The subscale of affective meaning needs further evaluation. A significant negative correlation was found between fatigue and epithelial atrophy in the intestine and a significant positive correlation was found between fatigue and diarrhea. These correlations imply a link between fatigue and intestinal injury. Signs of systemic inflammation were evident. In the interventional study_ 56% adhered to the intervention. Feasibility was limited by smell_ taste and consistency the preparation. The results indicated an alleviation of fatigue_ diarrhea and nausea during pelvic radiotherapy.","Upplevelse och lindring av fatigue och gastrointestinala symtom - hos patienter som genomgår strålbehandling"

The study was carried out in a 10 ha open area covered with gravel_ asphalt and grass_ surrounded by narrow street canyons. Measurements included an array of fixed wind and temperature sensors and smoke in the open area; temperature of the surrounding neighbourhood from mobile thermal mapping and fixed temperature sensors; standard climate measurements from four automatic weather stations in and around Goteborg. The results based on sixteen field surveys performed between December 1998 and March 2000 showed that the open urban area might generate a special type of IUTB under certain conditions. The IUTB was shown to be a rare nocturnal winter phenomenon developing during clear and calm weather conditions_ with snow covered ground_ strong ground based inversions and high stability (Ri(b) > 1). The most important driving forces for the generation of an IUTB were large intra-urban horizontal air temperature differences and strong atmospheric stability which led to decoupling of the canopy layer atmosphere from wind flow aloft. In order to estimate the physical principles underlying an IUTB of this type a simple 1.5-dimensional model was devised. Results indicated that the horizontal intra-urban air temperature difference recorded in Goteborg was enough to develop an IUTB.","An intra-urban thermal breeze in Göteborg_ Sweden."

Education has been found to be a key factor behind earnings inequality in Chile_ explaining 9-40%_ depending on the survey_ definition of income_ year_ method_ and sample used. Openness increased the demand for high-educated workers_ and thereby might have affected the rate of return to education and inequality. Higher female labour-force participation_ unemployment_ and higher minimum wage are found to have only small effects on aggregate measures of income inequality but are found to have larger impacts on quintiles income share. Simulated tax reforms imply small changes in inequality-indicators_ although redistribution and a flat tax-rate reduced the Gini coefficient from 0.488 to 0.438. The second paper analyzes earnings inequality in Chile using a decomposition of its change between 1992 and 2000. Both within-group and between-group composition-effects increased inequality_ while within-group and between-group change in variance reduced it. Using the inequality-decomposition of Fields and Yoo (2000) to analyze the inequality within-occupations it is found that even education and hours-worked had an increasing effect in overall inequality_ while all the other variables in the earnings equation and the residuals decreased inequality between 1992 and 2000.","Two Essays on Income Inequality in Chile"

Four types of subjective class were analysed separately for individuals with manual or non-manual occupational background. The cross-sectionalanalysis is based on the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey from 2000 and includes 4_139 individuals. The dataset comprises information on perceived class affinity and occupational position that was combined to conduct logistic regression models on self-rated health. An inverse relationship between self-rated health and the eight combinations of objective and subjective social position was found. Lower socio-economic position was associated with poor health. The largest adverse health effects were found for lower subjective social position in combination with lower occupational position. When the covariates education_ father’s occupational position and income were added to the model_ adverse effects on health remained only for females. Subjective social position helps to explain health inequalities. Substantial gender differences were found. It can be assumed that subjective class position captures a wide range of perceived inequalities and therefore complements the measure of occupational position.","The relevance of objective and subjective social position for self-rated health"

RE2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glasses have found several industrial applications_ for example as components of optical amplifiers and lasers. Many of these features stem from the high cation field-strength (CFS) of the trivalent RE ions (proportional to the valence of the ion divided by the square of its radius)_ which affects not only the physical properties of the glass_ but also their structures.This thesis deals with investigations of four different RE2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 systems_ where RE represents either of La_ Y_ Lu or Sc. The glass forming regions of the latter two were reported by us for the first time. Within each system_ glasses were prepared for variable RE_ Si and Al contents.The glass structures were investigated by solid-state 29Si and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that informs about the local Si and Al environments in the glass network_ which is built from interlinked SiO4 and AlO4 groups. Higher Al coordination numbers were also revealed by 27Al NMR: their amounts were observed to increase markedly as the CFS of the RE ion increases_ i.e._ along the series La&lt;Y&lt;Lu&lt;Sc. This thesis discusses such structure/composition relationships_ as well as the correlations between the glass composition and its physical properties of density_ molar volume_ compactness_ glass transition temperature_ Vickers hardness and refractive index.

This antibrane also gives rise to light moduli_ corresponding to angular motion around the tip. Following the work of Aharony_ Antebi_ and Berkooz_ we characterize the leading effects due to compactification that lift these potentially dangerous pseudomoduli.We show that the dominant contribution to the anti-D3-brane potential arises from nonperturbative effects stabilizing the K\"ahler moduli. In ten-dimensional supergravity_ this contribution is mediated by perturbations of three-form flux. Incorporating these flux perturbations_ we compute the leading contribution to the potential for angular motion of the anti-D3-brane. We show that the resulting mass is parametrically larger than that obtained in prior work.

For each axis_ we calculate quantitative proxy measures for all cities with more than 50_000 residents_ and then briefly discuss the strategies cities are using in response if they are deficient on one of the axes. We show that 523 million people are in cities where water availability may be an issue_ 890 million people are in cities where water quality may be an issue_ and 1.3 billion people are in cities where water delivery may be an issue. Tapping into groundwater is a widespread response_ regardless of the management challenge_ with many cities unsustainably using this resource. The strategies used by cities deficient on the water delivery axis are different than for cities deficient on the water quantity or water quality axis_ as lack of financial resources pushes cities toward a different and potentially less effective set of strategies.","Global Urban Growth and the Geography of Water Availability_ Quality_ and Delivery"

"oai_DiVA_org_su94032_7","Silicene consists of a monolayer of silicon atoms in a buckled honeycomb structure. It was recently discovered that the symmetry of such a system allows for interesting Rashba spin-orbit effects. A perpendicular electric field is able to couple to the sublattice pseudospin_ making it possible to electrically tune and close the band gap. Therefore_ external electric fields may generate a topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a normal insulator (or semimetal) and vice versa. The contribution of the present paper to the study of silicene is twofold. Firstly_ we perform a group theoretical analysis to systematically construct the Hamiltonian in the vicinity of the K points of the Brillouin zone and find an additional_ electric field induced spin-orbit term_ that is allowed by symmetry. Subsequently_ we identify a tight-binding model that corresponds to the group theoretically derived Hamiltonian near the K points. Secondly_ we start from this tight-binding model to analyze the topological phase diagram of silicene by an explicit calculation of the Z(2) topological invariant of the band structure. To this end_ we calculate the Z(2) topological invariant of the honeycomb lattice in a manifestly gauge invariant way which allows us to include S-z symmetry breaking terms-like Rashba spin-orbit interaction-into the topological analysis. Interestingly_ we find that the interplay of a Rashba and an intrinsic spin-orbit term can generate a non-trivial quantum spin Hall phase in silicene. This is in sharp contrast to the more extensively studied honeycomb system graphene where Rashba spin-orbit interaction is known to compete with the quantum spin Hall effect in a detrimental way.","Group theoretical and topological analysis of the quantum spin Hall effect in silicene"

In C. elegans_ the PR55/B regulatory subunit of PP2A_ which is encoded by sur-6_ positively regulates Ras-mediated vulval induction and acts at a step between Ras and Raf. We show that the catalytic subunit (C) of PP2A_ which is encoded by let-92_ also positively regulates vulval induction. Therefore SUR-6/PR55 and LET-92/PP2A-C probably act together to dephosphorylate a Ras pathway substrate. PP2A has been proposed to activate the Raf kinase by removing inhibitory phosphates from Ser259 from Raf-1 or from equivalent Akt phosphorylation sites in other Raf family members. However_ we find that mutant forms ofC. elegans LIN-45 RAF that lack these sites still require sur-6. Therefore_ SUR-6 must influence Raf activity via a different mechanism. SUR-6 and KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras) function at a similar step in Raf activation but our genetic analysis suggests that KSR activity is intact in sur-6 mutants. We identify the kinase PAR-1 as a negative regulator of vulval induction and show that it acts in opposition to SUR-6 and KSR-1. In addition to their roles in Ras signaling_ SUR-6/PR55 and LET-92/PP2A-C cooperate to control mitotic progression during early embryogenesis.","C. elegans SUR-6/PR55 cooperates with LET-92/protein phosphatase 2A and promotes Raf activity independently of inhibitory Akt phosphorylation sites"

Using precise forelimb movements in the cat as model_ spinal pathways contributing to motor restitution have been investigated in more detail. The food-taking movement by which the cat graSPS a morsel of food with the digits and brings it to the mouth is governed by interneurones in the forelimb segments (C6-Th1) and is normally controlled via the cortico- and rubrospinal tracts. Food-taking disappears after transection of these pathways in the dorsal part of the lateral funiculus (DLF) in C5/C6_ but then recovers during a period of 2-3 weeks. Experiments with double lesions showed that the recovery depends on a take-over via ipsilateral ventral systems; a ventrally descending pathway_ most probably cortico-reticulospinal_ and a pathway via propriospinal neurones in the C3-C4 segments. It is postulated that the recovery involves a plastic reorganization of these systems. Dexterous finger movements in the macaque monkey are generally considered to depend on the monosynaptic cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connexion_ which is lacking in the cat. Such movements are abolished after pyramidotomy at the level of the trapezoid body. However_ experiments with transection of the corticospinal tract in the DLF and partly ventral part of the lateral funiculus in C5_ showed a fast (1-28 days) recovery of precision grip and_ to some extent_ independent finger movements. Deficits in preshaping during the final approach to the morsel as well as lack of force were observed. A C5 DLF lesion spares corticofugal pathways to the brainstem and upper cervical segments. It is suggested that indirect corticomotoneuronal pathways may provide for recovery of dexterous finger movements and that the role of CM pathways for such movements should be broadened to include not only the monosynaptic connexion.","Skilled digit movements in feline and primate--recovery after selective spinal cord lesions."

We found BMD gains in the femoral neck in the ice hockey group compared with controls. However_ these gains were lost with reduced activity after cessation of career. INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that increasing bone mass by intense physical activity during childhood and adolescence may decrease the risk of osteoporosis later in life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this longitudinal study_ 43 ice hockey players (16.7 +/- 0.6 years) and 25 control subjects (16.8 +/- 0.3 years) were studied at baseline and after a mean period of 30 and 70 months. The groups did not differ in weight or height. Bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm2) was measured for total body_ femoral neck_ and spine using DXA. Volumetric BMD (vBMD; mg/cm3) of the femoral neck was estimated. RESULTS: The ice hockey players were found to have gained significantly more femoral neck BMD than controls (0.07 versus 0.03 g/cm2_ p = 0.04) and to have gained femoral neck vBMD_ whereas the controls did not (16 versus 0 mg/cm3_ p = 0.049) between baseline and the first follow-up. At the first follow-up_ the ice hockey players were found to have significantly higher BMD at the femoral neck and total body versus controls (p &lt; 0.05). Between the first and second follow-ups_ 21 ice hockey players stopped their active sports career. During this time period_ these subjects lost significantly more femoral neck BMD (0.10 versus 0.02 g/cm2_ p &lt; 0.001) and femoral neck vBMD (38 versus 4 mg/cm3_ p &lt; 0.001) compared with the 22 ice hockey players who continued training. The former ice hockey players also lost significantly more neck vBMD (38 versus 14 mg/cm3_ p = 0.009) compared with the controls during the same period. At the second follow-up_ only the 22 ice hockey players who had continued their training were found to have significantly higher BMD at the femoral neck (p = 0.01)_ total body (p = 0.04)_ and spine (p = 0.02) compared with the controls. The former athletes were found to have intermediate BMD at all sites. CONCLUSION: In summary_ we have demonstrated fast BMD loss at the femoral neck after decreased physical activity in young men. We conclude that ice hockey training during childhood and adolescence may not prevent the development of osteoporosis of the femoral neck later in life if the activity is not maintained.","Rapid loss of bone mineral density of the femoral neck after cessation of ice hockey training: a 6-year longitudinal study in males."

METHOD: Three hundred and forty children 2-13 years studied in connection with elective procedures which included anaesthesia. Parents completed the CBCL forms before and after hospitalization as well as the PHBQ 2 weeks after hospitalization. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis of PHBQ total score independent risk factors were: age &lt;5 (OR 2.4; CI 1.4-4.0)_ living in a one parent family (OR 4.4; CI: 1.6-12.6) and not living in a rural area (OR 1.6; CI: 1.0-2.6). The correlation between the total scores for PHBQ and CBCL for children aged 2-4 was moderate: (r = 0.38; p &lt; 0.005). For children aged 4-7 there were significant correlations between PHBQ sleep anxiety and CBCL Other problems (r = 0.4; p &lt; 0.01)_ PHBQ eating disturbances and CBCL total score (r = 0.3; p &lt; 0.01)_ though none of these significant correlations were observed for children above 7 years of age. CONCLUSION: There is an association between PHBQ and CBCL which is weaker for older children. The reason for this might be that PHBQ is more sensitive in the younger age group and to minor changes in behaviour. Children younger than 5 years of age or living in a one parent family or not living in rural areas appear to have higher incidence of problematic behaviour in a 2 week follow up after anaesthesia.","Child behaviour after anaesthesia: association of socioeconomic factors and child behaviour checklist to the Post-Hospital Behaviour Questionnaire"

Multidrug resistance gene (MDR1_ mdr1a_ and mdr1b) transcripts were found in human and rat glioma cell lines. P-Glycoprotein (Pgp) was immunohistochemically detected in glioma cell lines and in the rat brain vascular endothelial cell line (RBE4). A multidrug resistance pump efflux activity assay demonstrated increased calcein efflux of RBE4 endothelial cells_ but not glioma cells_ 2 h after irradiation and still increased 14 d after irradiation. The increased efflux was equally inhibited by verapamil with or without irradiation. In the rat intracranial glioma model (BT4C)_ Pgp was demonstrated in capillary endothelial cells of the tumor tissue and surrounding normal brain_ but not in tumor cells. The expression of gene transcripts or Pgp was not affected by irradiation. The results indicate that long-lasting verapamil-resistant drug efflux mechanisms are activated in brain endothelial cells after irradiation. The results might explain the poor efficacy of chemotherapy following radiotherapy and contribute to consideration of new treatment strategies in the management of malignant glioma.","Rapid induction of long-lasting drug efflux activity in brain vascular endothelial cells but not malignant glioma following irradiation"

We used spectroscopic analyses and transcriptome profiling to examine the mechanism by which the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus degrades organic matter when acquiring nitrogen from plant litter. The fungus partially degraded polysaccharides and modified the structure of polyphenols. The observed chemical changes were consistent with a hydroxyl radical attack_ involving Fenton chemistry similar to that of brown-rot fungi. The set of enzymes expressed by Pa. involutus during the degradation of the organic matter was similar to the set of enzymes involved in the oxidative degradation of wood by brown-rot fungi. However_ Pa. involutus lacked transcripts encoding extracellular enzymes needed for metabolizing the released carbon. The saprotrophic activity has been reduced to a radical-based biodegradation system that can efficiently disrupt the organic matter-protein complexes and thereby mobilize the entrapped nutrients. We suggest that the released carbon then becomes available for further degradation and assimilation by commensal microbes_ and that these activities have been lost in ectomycorrhizal fungi as an adaptation to symbiotic growth on host photosynthate. The interdependence of ectomycorrhizal symbionts and saprophytic microbes would provide a key link in the turnover of nutrients and carbon in forest ecosystems.","The ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus converts organic matter in plant litter using a trimmed brown-rot mechanism involving Fenton chemistry"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu123013_7","Summary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of limited blood sampling and Bayesian analysis to estimate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and tailor the dose of factor VIII (FVIII) in an individual patient. In a Bayesian analysis_ PK parameters are estimated from only a few plasma concentration measurements_ using a previously established PK model. First the necessary model was created using intense blood sampling FVIII data from 10 patients. Then FVIII data from another 21 patients were used for 'clinical' evaluation. Three scenarios were created retrospectively by reduction of the original 7-sample data set; blood sampling at 4_ 24 and 48 h_ at 8 and 30 h and at 24 h after the infusion. PK parameters were estimated for each individual using Bayesian analysis and compared with those obtained using conventional methods from the full data. The accuracy of predictions of FVIII levels during prophylactic treatment 5-17 months later and implications for dose tailoring were also investigated. Blood sampling at 4_ 24 and 48 h was found to give practically the same PK information as a full_ conventional (7-10-sample) study. Even a single 24-h FVIII level provided adequate data for initial dose tailoring and gave predictions of FVIII levels 5-17 months later that were not appreciably worse than predictions based on the full PK analysis. By contrast_ dose tailoring based on body weight failed completely. In conclusion_ PK-based dose tailoring of FVIII can be performed using limited blood sampling during prophylactic treatment.","Limited blood sampling for pharmacokinetic dose tailoring of FVIII in the prophylactic treatment of haemophilia A"

In a longitudinal study_ girls who participated in two assessments_ four to five years apart_ were divided into three groups according to the attitudes to eating that they manifested at the second evaluation: those with disturbed eating patterns (DE-group_ n = 49)_ those with intermediate concerns about eating (IE-group_ n = 260) and those with healthy eating attitudes (HE-group_ n = 120). Variables concerning attitudes to eating and weight and physical self-evaluation emerged as risk factors_ whereas personal standards or self-evaluation in general did not. Protective factors were a low BMI_ healthy eating attitudes_ an accepting attitude towards body size and a positive self-evaluation_ particularly with regard to physical and psychological characteristics.

Radiolabelled Affibody molecules can be used to visualize HER2 expression in tumour xenografts with high sensitivity. However_ previous studies demonstrated that the difference in uptake in xenografts with high and low HER2 expression levels is not proportional to the difference in expression levels. We hypothesized that discrimination between tumours with high and low HER2 expression may be improved by increasing the injected dose (reducing the specific activity) of the tracer. The influence of injected dose of anti-HER2 In-111-DOTA-Z(HER2) (342) Affibody molecule on uptake in SKOV-3 (high HER2 expression) and LS174T (low expression) xenografts was investigated. The optimal range of injected doses enabling discrimination between xenografts with high and low expression was determined. To verify this_ tumour uptake was measured in mice carrying both SKOV-3 and LS174T xenografts after injection of either 1 or 15 mu g In-111-DOTA-Z(HER2:342). An increase in the injected dose caused a linear decrease in the radioactivity accumulation in the LS174T xenografts (low HER2 expression). For SKOV-3 xenografts_ the dependence of the tumour uptake on the injected dose was less dramatic. The injection of 10-30 mu g In-111-DOTA-Z(HER2:342) per mouse led to the largest difference in uptake between the two types of tumour. Experiments in mice bearing two xenografts confirmed that the optimized injected dose enabled better discrimination of expression levels. Careful optimization of the injected dose of Affibody molecules is required for maximum discrimination between xenografts with high and low levels of HER2 expression. This information has potential relevance for clinical imaging applications.","Optimal specific radioactivity of anti-HER2 Affibody molecules enables discrimination between xenografts with high and low HER2 expression levels"

Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin. Methods In this randomized_ double-blind trial_ we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio_ 2.0 to 3.0) in 18_201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority_ with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. Results The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group_ as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban_ 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]_ 0.66 to 0.95; P&lt;0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group_ as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio_ 0.69; 95% CI_ 0.60 to 0.80; P&lt;0.001)_ and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%_ respectively (hazard ratio_ 0.89; 95% CI_ 0.80 to 0.99; P=0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group_ as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio_ 0.51; 95% CI_ 0.35 to 0.75; P&lt;0.001)_ and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio_ 0.92; 95% CI_ 0.74 to 1.13; P=0.42). Conclusions In patients with atrial fibrillation_ apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism_ caused less bleeding_ and resulted in lower mortality.","Apixaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation"

The decomposition at inert atmosphere conditions starts at the film/substrate interface_ which results in a high degree of ordering in the formed nickel film. In the H-2 atmosphere_ the initial film ordering is less pronounced and the decomposition occurs from the film surface and downward. This means that by choosing the annealing atmosphere_ inert or hydrogen_ the formation of the Ni film can be localized to either the original nitride/substrate interface or to the surface of the nitride. The annealed films show a cube-on-cube growth with respect to the SrTiO3 (001) substrate. The film morphology after the annealing experiments resembles the one of the as-deposited films. The lowest resistivity value is measured for the films annealed in the H-2 atmosphere. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society.

"oai_DiVA_org_uu19613_7","The Bandar Abbas-Strait of Hormuz zone is considered as a transition between the Zagros collision and the Makran oceanic subduction. We used GPS network measurements collected in 2000 and 2002 to better understand the distribution of the deformation between the collision zone and the Makran subduction. Analysing the GPS velocities_ we show that transfer of the deformation is mainly accommodated along the NNW–SSE-trending reverse right-lateral Zendan–Minab–Palami (ZMP) fault system. The rate is estimated to 10 ± 3 mm yr−1 near the faults. Assuming that the ZMP fault system transfers the motion between the Makran–Lut Block and the Arabian plate_ we estimate to 15 mm yr−1 and 6 mm yr−1_ respectively_ the dextral strike-slip and shortening components of the long-term transpressive displacement. Our geodetic measurements suggest also a 10–15 km locking depth for the ZMP fault system. The radial velocity pattern and the orientation of compressive strain axes around the straight of Hormuz is probably the consequence of the subducting Musandam promontory. The N–S Jiroft–Sabzevaran (JS) fault system prolongates southwards the dextral shear motion of the Nayband–Gowk (NG) fault system at an apparent rate of 3.1 ± 2.5 mm yr−1. The change from strong to weak coupling for underthrusting the Arabian plate beneath the Zagros (strong) and the Makran (weak) may explain the dextral motion along the ZMP_ JS/NG and Neh–Zahedan fault systems which transfer the convergence from a broad zone in the western Iran (Zagros_ Tabriz fault system_ Alborz_ Caucasus and Caspian sea surroundings) to Makran subduction.","Active deformation in Zagros-Makran transition zone inferred from GPS measurements"

However_ understanding of the sources of technical and interlaboratory variation is still limited. To address this_ the GEUVADIS consortium sequenced mRNAs and small RNAs of lymphoblastoid cell lines of 465 individuals in seven sequencing centers_ with a large number of replicates. The variation between laboratories appeared to be considerably smaller than the already limited biological variation. Laboratory effects were mainly seen in differences in insert size and GC content and could be adequately corrected for. In small-RNA sequencing_ the microRNA (miRNA) content differed widely between samples owing to competitive sequencing of rRNA fragments. This did not affect relative quantification of miRNAs. We conclude that distributing RNA sequencing among different laboratories is feasible_ given proper standardization and randomization procedures. We provide a set of quality measures and guidelines for assessing technical biases in RNA-seq data.","Reproducibility of high-throughput mRNA and small RNA sequencing across laboratories"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu221851_7","INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The Spanish flu reached Sweden in June 1918_ and at least one-third of the population (then 5.8 million) became infected. Some 34_500 persons (5.9 per 1_000 people) died from influenza during the first year of the pandemic (when acute pneumonia is included_ the number of deaths rose to 7.1 per 1_000 people). In this historical look back at the pandemic_ our aim was to review the epidemiological impact on the Swedish county of Uppsala_ the clinical outcomes and the economic impact on the regional hospital; a relevant backgound to consider the impact of a future virulent pandemic. We also focused on how the pandemic was perceived by the medical community and by health care authorities.METHODS: Health care reports_ statistics_ daily newspapers_ medical journals_ and records of patients treated for influenza at the Uppsala Academic Hospital from July 1918 to June 1919 were included in our review.RESULTS: An influenza related mortality rate of 693 persons (5.1 per 1_000 people) was reported in the Uppsala region from 1918-1919; from July 1918 to June 1919_ 384 patients were treated for influenza at the Uppsala Academic Hospital. The first wave peaked in November 1918 with case fatality rates up to 30%; a second wave peaked in April 1919 with a lower rate of mortality. Of the patients treated_ a total of 66 died. Of these_ 60% were 20-29 years of age_ and 85% were less than 40 years old. Autopsy reports revealed pneumonia in 89% of the cases; among these_ 47% were hemorrhagic_ 18% were bilateral_ and 45% had additional extrapulmonary organ involvement. Signs of severe viral disease were documented_ but secondary bacterial disease was the primary cause of death in the majority of cases.CONCLUSION: The epidemiologic and pathologic results were in accordance with other publications of this time period. The costs of running the hospital doubled from 1917 to 1920 and then reversed by 45%. Today_ an influenza pandemic of the same virulence would paralyze health care systems and result in extremely high financial costs and rates of mortality.","The Spanish flu in Uppsala_ clinical and epidemiological impact of the influenza pandemic 1918-1919 on a Swedish county"

Methods: A postal questionnaire was distributed nationwide to 4_000 randomly chosenindividuals 20–64 years of age_ with a response rate of 66%. A total of 1_041 respondents had legal custody of a child (150were single parents and 891 were couple parents)_ and thus met the definition of a parent used for this study. Analyses ofself-rated health and health care utilization were performed according to sex_ age_ sociodemographic_ and socioeconomiccharacteristics. Three different statistical methods were applied: Spearman correlation analyses_ chi-square analyses andmultivariate logistic regression. Results: Both single fathers and single mothers reported worse health than their couplecounterparts. However_ single fathers had contact with a physician more frequently (OR 1.84) than couple fathers_ whereassingle mothers did not. Furthermore_ single mothers refrained from seeing a physician despite a medical need much moreoften (OR 2.07) than couple mothers. Conclusions: An uneven distribution of sociodemographic and socioeconomiccharacteristics might help us to understand why single parents_ both mothers and fathers_ have worse health than parentswho live together.

METHODS: Study selection was based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Inclusion criteria included studies on adult patients (> or = 18 years) with TMD_ RA of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)_ AFP_ or BMS and a pain duration of > 3 months. Data sources included Medline_ Cochrane Li-brary_ Embase_ and Psych Litt. RESULTS: Eleven studies with a total of 368 patients met the inclusion criteria. Four trials were on TMD patients_ 2 on AFP_ 1 on BMS_ 1 on RA of the TMJ_ and 3 on mixed groups of patients with TMD and AFP. Of the latter_ amitriptyline was effective in 1 study and benzodiazepine in 2 studies; the effect in 1 of the benzodiazepine studies was improved when ibuprofen was also given. One study showed that intra-articular injection with glucocorti-coid relieved the pain of RA of the TMJ. In 1 study_ a combination of paracetamol_ codeine_ and doxylamine was effective in reducing TMD pain. No effective pharmacologic treatment was found for BMS. Only minor adverse effects were reported in the studies. CONCLUSION: The common use of analgesics in TMD_ AFP_ and BMS is not sup-ported by scientific evidence.

METHODS: Blood samples of hospitalized prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients were collected and processed to generate whole-blood and serum samples. Three different rapid two-site immunoassays were developed to measure the concentrations of total PSA (PSA-T)_ free PSA (PSA-F)_ and PSA-alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin complex (PSA-ACT) to detect in vitro changes in whole-blood samples immediately after venipuncture. The possible influence of muscle movement on the release of PSA from prostate gland was studied in healthy men by measuring the rapid in vitro whole-blood kinetics of PSA forms before and after 15 min of physical exercise on a stationary bicycle. RESULTS: Rapid PSA-T_ PSA-F_ and PSA-ACT assays were designed using a 10-min sample incubation. No significant changes were detected in the concentrations of PSA-T_ PSA-F_ and PSA-ACT from the earliest time point of 12-16 min compared with measurements performed up to 4 h after venipuncture. Physical exercise did not influence the concentrations of the circulating forms of PSA. Hematocrit-corrected whole-blood values of PSA-T and PSA-F forms were comparable to the respective serum values. Calculation of the percentage of PSA-F (PSA F/T ratio x 100) was similar irrespective of the sample format used_ i.e._ whole blood or serum. CONCLUSIONS: We found that immunodetectable PSA forms are likely at steady state immediately after venipuncture_ thus enabling the use of anticoagulated whole-blood samples in near-patient settings for point-of-care testing_ whereas determinations of PSA (e.g._ PSA-T_ PSA-F_ or PSA-ACT) performed within the time frame of the office visit would provide results equivalent to conventional analyses performed in serum.","Measurement of circulating forms of prostate-specific antigen in whole blood immediately after venipuncture: implications for point-of-care testing"

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1247337_7","Background and purpose Roentgen stereometric analysis (RSA) cannot discern whether a single prosthesis is fixed or migrating below the detection level. Samples of patients usually show migration values that appear to be continuously distributed. Is there such continuity_ or is there a dichotomy between stable and migrating prostheses? The hypothesis of a dichotomy has_ to our knowledge_ not been tested. We present an exploratory evaluation of such a dichotomy using a mixture distribution algorithm. Methods We analyzed the migration (as determined by RSA) of 147 cemented acetabular cups of 7 different designs by using a new set of algorithms for frequency distribution analysis called Rmix. Results We first analyzed a migration vector_ regardless of direction. After 2 years there was a significant dichotomy between 2 lognormal subgroups within the sample. Although some types of cups were over-represented in one of the subgroups_ neither cup design_ sex_ nor operating department could explain the dichotomy into two groups_ which appears to reflect the existence of two basically different types of behavior of the cups. We next analyzed the migration along the 3 axes in space_ and found a similar dichotomy. During the second year_ around 80% of the patients belonged to a distinct_ normally distributed subgroup with a mean not different from 0 mm and a small variation. The remainder differed significantly from this subgroup and showed migration. Interpretation There is a dichotomy in migration pattern. During the second postoperative year_ most cups belonged to a subpopulation that appeared stable. The remainder is probably at risk of loosening. For a single type of prosthesis_ the relative size of the stable subgroup may be a good index of the expected performance. The possibility of detecting subgroups within a seemingly continuous sample might be useful in many fields of medicine.","Fixed or loose? Dichotomy in RSA data for cemented cups"

The release rates for the substances depended on both the temperature and initial load in the vials. The catch from cotton rolls baited with 100 mug of the acetate or propionate of 3_7-dimethyl-2-pentadecanol was compared to the catch from regularly renewed cotton rolls baited with 10 mug of the same acetate. The catch was higher for the 100-mug cotton rolls for_ at most_ 45 days_ and there was no significant difference in catch between the acetate and the propionate. The catch in traps baited with polyethylene or cotton roll dispensers loaded with the acetate of 3_7-dimethyl-2-pentadecanol was compared and showed that cotton roll traps mirrored the decreasing release of the substance rather than the actual Right activity. The length of the flight period of N. sertifer in Sweden_ the Czech Republic_ Italy_ and Greece did not exceed 100 days in any of the countries. By adjusting the initial pheromone load of the polyethylene vials to the expected temperatures_ it should be possible to get a constant and sufficiently high release rate during the entire flight period.","Release rates for pine sawfly pheromones from two types of dispensers and phenology of Neodiprion sertifer"

The objective of this study was to determine nicotine absorption for current pouched and loose snus products in comparison with a cigarette and an over-the-counter nicotine gum. We conducted an open-label_ randomized_ 6-way_ crossover study involving 20 healthy snus and cigarette users. One of 6 products (2 pouched snus_ 2 weights of loose snus_ a cigarette_ and a nicotine gum) was administered at each of 6 visits. Blood samples were taken at intervals over 120 min and sensory perception assessed by questionnaire. For the 4 smokeless tobacco products and the nicotine gum_ blood plasma levels of nicotine were ranked according to total nicotine content as follows: loose snus (27.1 mg nicotine) &gt; pouched snus (14.7 mg nicotine) &gt; loose snus (10.8 mg nicotine) = pouched snus (10.7 mg nicotine) &gt; nicotine gum (4.2 mg nicotine). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C-max) of nicotine ranged from 26.9 to 13.1 ng.h/ml and 17.9 to 9.1 ng.h/ml_ respectively across all the products. Nicotine was absorbed more rapidly from the cigarette but systemic exposure was within the range of the smokeless tobacco products (AUC = 14.8 ng.h/ml; C-max = 12.8 ng.h/ml). This study has generated new information on comparative nicotine absorption from a cigarette_ loose snus_ and pouched snus typical of products sold in Scandinavia. The similar nicotine absorption for 1 g portions of loose and pouched snus with approximately 11 mg of nicotine indicate that absorption kinetics were dependent on quantity of tobacco by weight and total nicotine content rather than product form.","Determination of Nicotine Absorption from Multiple Tobacco Products and Nicotine Gum"

The length_ however_ is not absolute due to pronounced heteroplasmy caused by variable numbers of two types of repetitive motifs in the control region. The sequence of the repeats is (a) 5&#39;-CACACCCA and (b) 5&#39;-TGCGCGCA_ respectively. The order of (a) and (b) can be expressed as {n2(a)+(b)+m(a)}. In 32 different clones analyzed the number of n and m ranged from 0 to 9 and 1 to 7. The two rRNA genes_ the 13 peptide-coding genes_ and the 22 tRNA genes of the donkey and the horse_ Equus caballus_ were compared in detail. Total nucleotide difference outside the control region was 6.9%. Nucleotide difference between peptide-coding genes ranged from 6.4% to 9.4% with a mean of 8.0%. In the inferred protein sequences of the 13 peptide-coding genes the amino acid difference was 0.2-8.8%_ and the mean for the 13 concatenated amino acid sequences was 1.9%. In the 22 tRNA genes_ the mean difference was 3.5%_ and that in the two rRNA genes was 4.1%. The mtDNA differences between the donkey and the horse suggest that the evolutionary separation of the two species occurred approximate to 9 million years ago. Analyses of differences among the mtDNAs of three other species-pairs_ harbor seal/grey seal_ fin whale/blue whale_ and Homo/common chimpanzee_ showed that the relative evolutionary rate of individual peptide-coding genes varies among different species-pairs and modes of comparison. The findings show that the superimposition of sequence data of one lineage for resolving and dating evolutionary divergences of other lineages should be performed with caution unless based on comprehensive data.","The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the donkey and mtDNA comparisons among four closely related mammalian species-pairs"

In oxidative ammonolysis_ the relatively large_ freshly prepared MoO3 crystals are reduced to smaller MoO2 crystals with a crystallite size of 5–30 nm. This process gives a perfectly pseudomorphous product with pores less than 5 nm. The specific surface area increases from &lt;0.1 m2/g to almost 40 m2/g. In subsequent ammoxidation_ MoO2 transforms first into orthorhombic Mo4O11 and finally into MoO3. The crystals of Mo4O11 are about 1 μm in diameter_ and their formation leads to a decrease of specific surface area. The original MoO3 morphology is retained even after the sequence of transformation as follows: MoO3 → MoO2 → Mo4O11 (→MoO3). In some cases_ the new generation of MoO3 crystals grows parallel to the original MoO3 crystals.","Electron microscopy of some molybdenum oxide phases after use as catalysts in oxidative ammonolysis and ammoxidation of toluene"

More specifically_ four questions are addressed: (1) What do we know about the term barrier_ how can it be defined? (2) What types of barriers to growth and development have been identified? (3) How can barriers to growth and development be addressed in a framework? and (4) How do the results of the appended papers (Papers I-V) contribute to the research field of barriers to growth and development? A literature review was undertaken to answer the first two questions. The literature review was conducted in two phases. The conceptual and operational definition of barriers was addressed in the first phase. The results reveal diverse ways of focusing on barriers_ which made it necessary to address similar terms_ such as problem and causes of business failure in the second phase of the literature review. The different terms used in the papers of the literature review are discussed in order to determine whether or not the understanding of their content is coherent and conceptual. Based on the conceptual understanding and definition of barriers_ the different aspects focused on in the literature were discussed_ which led to the second question_ What are the various aspects of barriers to growth and development? The knowledge gained from the literature review and the development of the understanding of the barrier concept led to the third question_ Can barriers to growth and development be addressed in a framework? The discussion takes its starting point in the studies identified in the literature review and is related to some of the appended papers (Papers I and II). Similarities and differences between frameworks used in the papers identified in the literature review are discussed and_ based on this knowledge_ a framework for barriers to growth and development in small firms is presented. The framework distinguishes two types of barriers_ namely internal/external barriers and tangible/intangible barriers. The knowledge available in the reviewed papers within the field of barriers to growth and development in small firms in combination with the results from the appended papers (Papers I-V) resulted in the fourth question. Part of the contribution of the appended papers concerns the operational definition_ for example that barriers to innovation should be categorised as either occurring or preventing firms from innovating (Paper II)_ while other contributions concern specific types of barriers_ for example the importance of managerial skills (Paper V). Overall_ the contribution focuses on conditional factors_ such as strategy and planning_ organisation and management_ and institution and policy factors_ in relation to growth and development.","Barriers to growth and development in small firms"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_101515_7","This paper describes a novel method for introducing the RGD cell adhesion peptide to enhance cell adhesion onto bacterial cellulose (BC). BC and cotton linters as reference were modified with xyloglucan (XG) and xyloglugan bearing a GRGDS pentapeptide. The adsorptions followed Langmuir adsorption behavior_ where both XGs probably decorate the cellulose surfaces as a monolayer. The adsorption maximum of the XGs reached around 180 mg/g on BC and only about three times as much on cotton linters. The adsorption was verified with colorimetric methods. The specific surface area of BC measured with XG and XG-GRGDS was about 200 m (2)/g and was almost three times less for cotton linters_ 60 m (2)/g. The difference in the amounts of XGs adsorbed might be explained by the swollen network of bacterial cellulose and a more exposed and accessible bulk as compared to cotton linters. The nanocellulose material was modified homogeneously throughout the material_ as seen by the z-scan in confocal microscopy. Moreover_ the modification in the water phase_ in comparison with organic solvents_ was clearly advantageous for preserving the morphology_ as observed with SEM. The modification slightly increased the wettability_ which might explain the decrease in or undetectable adsorption of adhesive protein shown by QCM-D. Initial cell studies showed that adhesion of human endothelial cells is enhanced when the BC hydrogel is modified with XG-GRGDS. QCM-D studies further revealed that the cell enhancement is due to the presence of the RGD epitope on XG and not to a nonspecific adsorption of fibronectin from cell culture medium. Optimization and proliferation studies of human endothelial cells onto bacterial cellulose modified with XG-GRGDS are currently being carried out at the Vascular Engineering Center_ Sahlgrenska University Hospital_ Gothenburg.","Modification of nanocellulose with a xyloglucan-RGD conjugate enhances adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells: implications for tissue engineering."

Design Case-control study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied tumour progression rate in 121 patients with hypopituitarism on the basis of non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) receiving long-term GHRT. A group of 114 NFPA patients not receiving GHRT who were matched in terms of duration of follow-up_ gender_ age_ age at diagnosis and radiotherapy status were used as a control population. The average duration of GHRT was 10+/-4 years (range 2-17). RESULTS: In patients with a known residual adenoma_ 63% had no detectable enlargement of tumour during the study. In patients who had no visible residual tumour prior to GHRT_ 90% did not suffer from recurrence. In total_ the 10-year tumour progression-free survival rate in patients with NFPA receiving GHRT was 74%. In the control population not receiving GHRT_ the 10-year progression-free survival rate was 70%. Radiotherapy as part of the initial tumour treatment reduced the rate of tumour progression in both GHRT and non-GHRT patients to a similar extent. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of tumour progression was similar in this large group of GHRT patients and the control population not receiving GHRT. Our results provide further support that long-term use of GH replacement in hypopituitarism may be considered safe in patients with residual pituitary adenomas.","Comparing progression of non-functioning pituitary adenomas in hypopituitarism patients with and without long-term GH replacement therapy."

These models need to balance the demands for accuracy_ ease of parameterization and simulation efficiency. The application in focus in this work is the transient engine speed control during an automated gear shift sequence of a heavy duty truck. In the case of an upshift_ the engine must rapidly be decelerated to the new synchronous speed. Since the normal engine friction is small_ the engine compression brake is activated. A dedicated engine simulation model is needed in order to be able to develop a controller for this sequence. This report presents a crank angle based diesel engine model_ especially well suited for simulation and development of control strategies for the transients during automated gear shifts in a heavy duty truck. It includes compression brake capabilities. The model can be characterized as a “filling and emptying”-model_ using the ideal gas law and standard equations for flow restrictions connecting lumped control volumes. An empirical combustion model is used_ assuming adiabatic conditions in the cylinder. During no-load or when the compression brake is active_ cylinder wall heat exchange is taken into account. A tuning procedure is outlined and pursued for a 12 litre turbocharged Volvo diesel engine. The simulations agree well with measurements. An example to show the usefulness of the model is given where the rapid engine speed deceleration during an upshift is studied.","Simulation and transient control of diesel engine compression brake"

In total_ we performed 658 treatments on 377 patients at our department during 2004. Larger sized treatment areas were the strongest pain predictor_ and actinic keratoses were more painful to treat than basal cell carcinomas and Bowen's disease. The most sensitive areas to treat were the face and scalp. Gender and age did not influence pain. Although treatment outcome was not our primary objective_ 62% of 95 superficial basal cell carcinomas that were followed for 3 years showed complete clearance. Also_ perforation of nodular basal cell carcinomas did not lead to better clinical results. In conclusion_ the size of the treatment area_ the diagnosis and the lesion location influence pain during PDT. Never-theless_ there is a large variance in visual analogue scale assessment within each group_ thereby limiting the ability to predict pain.","Predictors of Pain Associated with Photodynamic Therapy: A Retrospective Study of 658 Treatments."

The Mediterranean area is a biodiversity hotspot that is increasingly threatened by intense land use. Therefore_ to achieve a balance between conservation and human development_ a better understanding of the impact of land use on the underlying fungal communities is needed. We used parallel pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal ITS regions to characterize the fungal communities in five soils subjected to different anthropogenic impact in a typical Mediterranean landscape: a natural cork-oak forest_ a pasture_ a managed meadow_ and two vineyards. Marked differences in the distribution of taxon assemblages among the different sites and communities were found. Data analyses consistently indicated a sharp distinction of the fungal community of the cork oak forest soil from those described in the other soils. Each soil showed features of the fungal assemblages retrieved which can be easily related to the above-ground settings: ectomycorrhizal phylotypes were numerous in natural sites covered by trees_ but were nearly completely missing from the anthropogenic and grass-covered sites; similarly_ coprophilous fungi were common in grazed sites. Data suggest that investigation on the below-ground fungal community may provide useful elements on the above-ground features such as vegetation coverage and agronomic procedures_ allowing to assess the cost of anthropogenic land use to hidden diversity in soil. Datasets provided in this study may contribute to future searches for fungal bio-indicators as biodiversity markers of a specific site or a land-use degree.","Unravelling soil fungal communities from different Mediterranean land-use backgrounds"

Furthermore_ the difference between children colonised with mutans streptococci (MS) at an early or late stage with regard to the prevalence of carious lesions was determined. Methods: The children of first-time mothers selected on the basis of high salivary levels of MS for participation in a caries prevention programme were recalled at the age of 19 years. They were examined for salivary MS_ lesion prevalence (decayed and filled surfaces_ DFS) and MS in plaque from 12 selected proximal surfaces. Results: The recall rate was 70% for the children of both the high-control and interventional groups. All high-control children and 67% of the interventional children were colonised by MS. All the children with non-detectable MS in saliva were also negative in all plaque samples. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of DFS_ although more interventional children were caries free than in the control group. Early-colonised children_ irrespective of group iden-tity_ had higher salivary MS levels and DES than later MS-colonised children. Conclusion: The results indicate that it is possible to remain negative for MS into adulthood if non-colonised at an early age and this affects the development of carious lesions. Strategies for the prevention of dental caries in early childhood should_ therefore_ include measures to prevent or delay early colonisation by cariogenic bacteria. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

The disease activity was measured using Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score/Wegener's granulomatosis (BVAS/WG score)_ and clinical laboratory variables were recorded. The median BVAS/WG score before treatment was 6 (IQR 3-8)_ and 28 patients (97%) had disease flare classified either severe (62%) or limited (34%). Six of 29 patients (21%) achieved a complete remission_ and 12 (41%) had a treatment response with ≥50% decrease in BVAS/WG score at 6 months. Fourteen patients (64%) with kidney involvement achieved remission_ and in seven patients (50%)_ no flare was seen during the follow-up period. Three patients had renal flare and were successfully re-treated with RTX. Seventeen patients had disease symptoms from airways and eyes at RTX initiation_ whereas only 29% displayed ≥50% treatment response.

"oai_services_scigloo_org_18706_7","This thesis analyzes the worlds future energy supply in general_ and cost-effective fuel choices in the transportation sector in particular_ under stringent CO2 constraints. The analysis is carried out with the help of a global energy systems model (GET)_ developed and modified specifically for each project. GET is a linear programming model and it has three end-use sectors: electricity_ heat and transportation fuel. It is set up to generate the energy supply mix that would meet exogenously given energy demand levels at the lowest global cost. This thesis consists of the following three papers (i) an analysis of why two similar global energy systems models_ GET and BEAP_ give different results as to whether biofuels will become cost-effective in the transportation sector_ (ii) an analysis of cost effective fuel choices in a regionalized version of the GET model and (iii) an analysis of the cost dynamics in the GET model in a further developed version of the model. Conclusions drawn within the scope of this thesis are that biomass is most cost-effectively used for heat production at low CO2 taxes_ up to about 75 USD/tC_ as shown in both the GET and the BEAP model. The sector in which biomass is most cost-effectively used at higher CO2 taxes depends on assumed possible energy carriers and technologies. If hydrogen and/or electricity derived from carbon free energy sources will not be available in the transportation sector at sufficiently low costs_ biofuels become an important option if low or zero carbon emissions are to be achieved. Thus_ the long run future for the cost-effective transportation fuel choice is still in the open. Regionalizing the GET 1.0 model will not affect the overall pattern of transportation fuel choices_ i.e. that gasoline/diesel remain for some decades in the transportation sector until the carbon constraint becomes increasingly stringent and that solar based hydrogen dominates by the end of this century. In paper III_ we find that the required carbon tax level where biofuels become cost-efficient_ compared to fossil based fuels_ is evasive. The tax level moves upwards with increasing carbon taxes_ since this leads to an increasing biomass primary energy price in the model.","Cost-effective fuel choices in the transportation sector under stringent CO2-emission reduction targets - Global energy systems modelling"

Due to its aromatic nature_ lignin is recognized as being a potential feedstock for producing transportation fuel and high value-added chemicals. Nowadays_ most of the lignin (almost 99%) produced in the Kraft pulping process is used as internal fuel. A modern Kraft mill has an energy surplus and_ therefore_ the potential of being a large scale biorefinery: one option is to extract lignin from black liquor_ make it a new source of specialty chemicals and fuel. Furthermore_ a new process_ called “LignoBoost”_ has recently been developed to extract a high quantity of pure lignin and has gained commercial status. Therefore_ in years to come_ a huge amount of LignoBoost Kraft lignin is expected to be available for valorisation. In this work_ the catalytic conversion of LignoBoost Kraft lignin into liquid products at near-critical condition in water_ using ZrO2/K2CO3 as the catalytic system and phenol as the co-solvent_ was carried out in the small pilot unit_ developed by_ and located at_ Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg_ Sweden. The plant_ operated in continuous mode_ was fed with lignin slurry at a flow rate of 1 kg/h. The analytical procedure for the reaction products has been developed in order to determine the composition of the liquid products. In addition_ the influence of K2CO3 concentration and reaction temperature was investigated in order to optimise the yields of the liquid products obtained. The results show that the K2CO3 concentration and reaction temperature exert different effects in terms of the composition and yields of the resulting products. The reaction products obtained from this process consist of water-soluble organics (5–11% on a dry lignin basis)_ lignin-oil (69–88%) and char (16–22%). The main 1-ring aromatic compounds (found in water-soluble organics and diethyl ether-soluble lignin-oil) are anisoles_ alkylphenols_ guaiacols and catechols_ showing different trends with K2CO3 concentration and reaction temperature. In addition_ the reaction temperature has a relatively large effect on alkylphenols_ whereas K2CO3 has a relatively large effect on anisoles. The lignin-oil_ being partially deoxygenated_ has higher carbon content and heat value_ but lower content of sulphur_ than lignin in the feed.","Catalytic conversion of LignoBoost Kraft lignin into liquid products in near-critical water"

Moreover_ effectiveness was significantly improved. The cost-effectiveness ratio for treatment A was € 14_840 vs. € 31_908 for treatment B. In addition_ 75% of the participants in treatment A were successfully rehabilitated vs. 55% in treatment B. Conclusion The use of an ICP was cost-effective_ with the greatest reduction in hotel costs. A longer hospital stay was related to more investigation costs_ which appeared to be unrelated to the participants’ medical condition. The cost of developing the ICP had already been covered after three partici-pants. No 30-day re-admission was recorded in either group and the one-year mortality rate was 16% in both groups.","Integrated care pathways and Patient-centered care a cost-effective combination"

We now propose that adult size is determined to an important extent during transition from infancy to childhood. This transition is marked by a growth spurt. A delay in the transition has a lifelong impact on stature and is responsible for 44% of children with short stature in developed countries and many more in developing countries. Here_ we present the data and theory of an evolutionary adaptive strategy of plasticity in the timing of transition from infancy into childhood to match the prevailing energy supply. We propose that humans have evolved to withstand energy crises by decreasing their body size_ and that evolutionary short-term adaptations to energy crises trigger a predictive adaptive response that modify the transition into childhood_ culminating in short stature.","Evo-devo of infantile and childhood growth"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_77958_7","Spray-wall interaction has been found to influence the rate of heat release and the formation of emissions in DI diesel engines. Experimental and numerical studies of sprays impinging on a wall have shown that the heat transfer and droplet size and velocity distributions vary when there is a change of such parameters as wall temperature_ air temperature_ injection pressure and distance to the wall. The objective of this work is to experimentally study how the surface temperature of a wall and different air temperatures affect the properties of an impinging spray of a two--component model fuel (IDEA) that consists of 70 % n-decane and 30 % 1-methylnaphthalene using rapid thermocouples and a phase doppler particle analyzer (PDPA). The experiments were carried out in the high-pressure_ high-temperature (HP/HT) spray rig at Chalmers. Air temperatures were chosen to achieve both evaporating and non-evaporating conditions of the fuel. The air pressure was adjusted to give the same density for all cases. A standard common rail system controlled by a solenoid valve together with a single-hole nozzle was used for two different fuel injection pressures.","Characterization of diesel model fuel sprays impinging on a temperature controlled wall using rapid thermocouples and PDPA (Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer)"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_94674_7","This thesis describes and analyzes intercultural communication between non-Swedish physicians and their Swedish patients_ as well as communication between non-Swedish physicians and Swedish medical personnel. The focus is on the impact of cultural differences and the use of Swedish as a foreign language by physicians. In addition_ the effects of gender and power in physician-patient and physician-colleague communication were investigated. The thesis is based on a combination of data collection methods (interviews_ questionnaires_ recordings of naturally occurring medical consultations and staff meetings_ and observations) and data analysis (qualitative and quantitative). The goal was to get as complete a picture as possible of intercultural communication in Swedish health care. The thesis presents a general analysis of communication between non-Swedish physicians and their Swedish patients. This analysis includes the views of non-Swedish physicians_ Swedish patients and Swedish personnel about communication_ an outline of common problems and how the participants solve them_ and an overview of the positive aspects of communication. A particular focus of the thesis is the comparative analysis of some aspects of information seeking (analysis of questions used by the non-Swedish and Swedish physicians and their patients in medical consultations)_ information giving (use of the pronoun man [‘one’] by the Swedish and non-Swedish physicians while providing information to their patients)_ and acknowledgment and checking (use of repetitions and reformulations for feedback purposes). In addition_ an overall comparative analysis of intercultural and Swedish medical consultations was done. Differences and similarities between male and female Swedish and non-Swedish physicians and male and female Swedish patients and personnel are discussed. The power relationship in intercultural medical consultations in which the physician is “weaker” and the patient “stronger” in terms of language competence was analyzed. Furthermore_ by comparing “intercultural” communication (between the non-Swedish physicians and Swedish patients) to “monocultural” communication (between Swedish physicians and Swedish patients)_ some insight into Swedish culture and communication patterns was gained. The work concludes with some ideas for teaching and training developed on the basis of the findings of the thesis.","Intercultural communication in health care. Non-Swedish physicians in Sweden"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth61181_7","We study simulated annealing algorithms to maximise a function psi on a subset of R(d). In classical simulated annealing_ given a current state theta(n) in stage n of the algorithm_ the probability to accept a proposed state z at which psi is smaller_ is exp(-beta(n+1)(psi(z) - psi (theta(n))) where (beta(n)) is the inverse temperature. With the standard logarithmic increase of (beta(n)) the probability P(psi(theta(n)) &lt;= psi(max) - epsilon)_ with psi(max) the maximal value of psi_ then tends to zero at a logarithmic rate as n increases. We examine variations of this scheme in which (beta(n)) is allowed to grow faster_ but also consider other functions than the exponential for determining acceptance probabilities. The main result shows that faster rates of convergence can be obtained_ both with the exponential and other acceptance functions. We also show how the algorithm may be applied to functions that cannot be computed exactly but only approximated_ and give an example of maximising the log-likelihood function for a state-space model.","Fast simulated annealing in Rd with an application to maximum likelihood estimation in state-space models"

This is partly due to reduced P-selectin-dependent leukocyte-and platelet-endothelial cell interactions_ however_ the mechanism behind this protective effect is still unknown. In the present study a combination of culture dependent and molecular based T-RFLP profiling was used to investigate the influence of L. reuteri on the colonic mucosal barrier of DSS treated rats. It was first demonstrated that the two colonic mucus layers of control animals had different bacterial community composition and that fewer bacteria resided in the firmly adherent layer. During DSS induced colitis_ the number of bacteria in the inner firmly adherent mucus layer increased and bacterial composition of the two layers no longer differed. In addition_ induction of colitis dramatically altered the microbial composition in both firmly and loosely adherent mucus layers. Despite protecting against colitis_ treatment with L. reuteri did not improve the integrity of the mucus layer or prevent distortion of the mucus microbiota caused by DSS. However_ L. reuteri decreased the bacterial translocation from the intestine to mesenteric lymph nodes during DSS treatment_ which might be an important part of the mechanisms by which L. reuteri ameliorates DSS induced colitis.","Lactobacillus reuteri Maintains a Functional Mucosal Barrier during DSS Treatment Despite Mucus Layer Dysfunction"

The density of the QDs is about 2.5 Ã— 1010 cm -2 per QD layer. The photoluminescence (PL) peak wavelength at 1322 nm corresponding to the interband transition of the QD ground states was observed at room temperature with a full width at half-maximum of 49 meV. A good uniformity of the QD structure across the 4" wafer was verified with a variation of the PL peak wavelength of 0.9 % from the wafer center to the edge. Top p-contacts and a bottom n-contact were processed on the QD structure_ and electroluminescence (EL) spectra were measured at different temperatures.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth7151_7","In a previous study we have shown that correction of peripheral refractive errors can improve the remaining vision of subjects with large central visual field loss. Measuring peripheral refractive errors with traditional methods is often difficult due to low visual acuity and large aberrations. Therefore a Hartmann-Shack sensor has been designed to measure peripheral wave front aberrations in subjects using eccentric viewing. The sensor incorporates an eye tracker and analyzing software designed to handle large wave front aberrations and elliptic pupils. To ensure that the measurement axis is aligned with the direction of the subject's preferred retinal location_ a special fixation target has been developed. It consists of concentric rings surrounding the aperture of the sensor together with a central fixation mark along the measurement axis. Some initial measurements on subjects using eccentric viewing have been performed successfully. As a first step in improving the peripheral optics of the eye_ the wave front has been used to calculate the eccentric refraction. This refraction has been compared to the refraction found with the Power-Refractor instrument. Measuring the off-axis wave front is a fast way to assess the optical errors in the subject's eccentric viewing angle and to better understand the problems of eccentric correction.","Off-axis wave front measurements for optical correction in eccentric viewing"

Here_ a novel picoma-like virus_ Nora virus_ which causes a persistent infection in Drosophila melanogaster_ is described. It has a sing le-stranded_ positive-sense genomic RNA of 11879 nt_ followed by a poly(A) tail. Unlike other picoma-like viruses_ the genome has four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes a picornavirus-like cassette of proteins for virus replication_ including an iflavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a helicase that is related to those of mammalian picornaviruses. The three other ORFs are not closely related to any previously described viral sequences. The unusual sequence and genome organization in Nora virus suggest that it belongs to a new family of picorna-like viruses. Surprisingly_ Nora virus could be detected in all tested D. melanogaster laboratory stocks_ as well as in wild-caught material. The viral titres varied enormously_ between 10(4) and 10(10) viral genomes per fly in different stocks_ without causing obvious pathological effects. The virus was also found in Drosophila simulans_ a close relative of D. melanogaster_ but not in more distantly related Drosophila species.

Modern drug design typically includes both sequence bioinformatics_ in silico virtual screening_ and free energy calculations_ e.g. of drug binding.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activities of 16 antibiotics against S. epidermidis isolated from PJIs_ with special focus on rifampicin and rpoB variability. Ninety-one per cent of the isolates were multiresistant (i.e. resistant to members of more than three classes of antibiotics). Thirty-nine per cent were resistant to rifampicin_ associated with one or two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rpoB. Using IsoSensitest agar with supplements_ 61% were resistant to oxacillin_ and using Mueller-Hinton II agar with supplement_ 84% were resistant. Using the Etest_ 58% were resistant to cefoxitin_ and using the disk diffusion test_ 91% were resistant. The mecA gene was detected in 85% of the isolates. Regarding recently available antibiotics_ all isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid_ and 97% were susceptible to daptomycin. In addition_ two novel antibiotics_ dalbavancin and ceftobiprole_ were tested_ although not yet available for routine use. The MIC50 and MIC90 values of these novel antibiotics were 0.032 and 0.047 mg/L and 0.5 and 1.5 mg/L_ respectively. Among the other antibiotics_ the rates of resistance varied between 0% (vancomycin) and 82% (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole). S. epidermidis strains causing PJIs often show multiresistance_ including resistance to rifampicin_ which is mainly caused by one or two SNPs. Some of the newer antimicrobial agents may provide alternatives for monotherapy or combination therapy with rifampicin. Detection of mecA is necessary before initiating treatment of infections due to S. epidermidis when it displays intermediate susceptibility to cefoxitin.","Antibiotic susceptibility among Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from prosthetic joint infections with special focus on rifampicin and variability of the rpoB gene"

However_ there is still a need for more knowledge about the attitudes and awareness of undergraduate nursing students. Aim. To investigate Swedish undergraduate nursing students' attitudes towards and awareness of research and development within nursing_ and to illuminate factors that may have an impact on their attitudes and awareness. Methods. A questionnaire consisting of three parts: demographic data_ attitude scale_ and research awareness was used. Parametric and nonparametric statistics were used. Two hundred and one students participated in the study and the response rate was 77%. Cronbach's alpha test on the seven factors was between 0.52 and 0.80. Results. Most of the students had positive attitudes towards nursing research. More than half (60%) of the students expected to make use of nursing research sometime in the future and about 25% had never read any of the scientific nursing journals. The majority (77%) of the students were acquainted with at least one Swedish researcher_ but few had attended a doctoral dissertation. Students with an interest in some particular development or research area in nursing were significantly more positive and expected to make use of nursing research more frequently. Other variables that were found to have some impact upon attitudes were gender_ age and additional academic studies. Conclusion. Nursing students had an overall positive attitude towards nursing research and their interest in a particular development or research area was the most important variable for their attitudes and expected use of nursing research in the future. Therefore_ it would seem to be important to encourage the students' interest in specific development/research areas of nursing during their education. In spite of the nursing students' positive attitudes to nursing research_ the study demonstrates the theory-practice gap is still present to some degree.","Swedish nursing students' attitudes to and awareness of research and development within nursing"

Such functions effect a tradeoff between pure spatial- and frequency-domain descriptions. The authors explain the use of such representations in vision_ considered as a process in inference from the retinal signals to a symbolic description. The appropriate mathematical structure for the inference is that of the subspaces of the signal vector space_ a feature which it shares with quantum mechanics. The theory is derived directly from the fundamental constraints on visual inference. It is then shown to be consistent with many of the known properties of the visual system. In particular_ a major feature of the inference system-the occurrence of interference effects-has already been observed in visual system operation","Uncertainty and Inference in the Visual System"

This thesis focuses on the surface interactions between nanocrystals of (a) RE2O3 (RE = Y or Gd); and (b) TiO2 and organic molecules_ which have been studied experimentally and by quantum-chemical calculations with the intent to elucidate the chemisorption characteristics such as adsorption geometries and energies.(a) RE2O3 nanocrystal synthesis was performed by a colloidal method based on polyols and by a rapid combustion method. The products were experimentally characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)_ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)_ infrared spectroscopy (IR)_ Raman_ and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). By quantum chemical calculations the chemisorption of formic acid_ DEG_ water and TMOS at the surface of RE12O18 clusters was studied. From comparison between calculated and experimental vibrational spectra_ the binding mode for formic acid on RE2O3 was inferred to be of bridge or bidentate type. XPS and IR showed that DEG chemisorbs on the particle surface and experimental IR spectra of DEG chemisorbed on RE2O3 were consistent with an adsorption mode where the hydroxyl groups are deprotonated according to the quantum-chemical computations.(b) Synthesis of single-phase rutile TiO2 nanocrystals was done by a sol-gel method and the nanocrystals was subsequently functionalized by organic acids and glycine. Quantum-chemical studies indicate that formic- and acetic acid adsorbs in a bridge or monodentate binding mode_ while glycine is suggested to adsorb as a zwitterion with bridge bonded carboxylic group and a hydrogen bonded amino group. However_ spectroscopic data showed that the amino acid_ unlike the other acids did not adsorb on TiO2 under the given experimental conditions.","Experimental and quantum-chemical studies of the surface interactions between organic molecules and nanocrystals of (a) RE2O3 (RE = Y or Gd); and (b) TiOb2"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu45468_7","Factors controlling the onset and progression of extracellular amyloid diseases remain largely unknown. Central to disease etiology is the efficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) machinery that targets destabilized mutant proteins for degradation and the enhanced tendency of these variants to aggregate if secreted. We demonstrate that mammalian cells secrete numerous transthyretin (TTR) disease-associated variants with wild-type efficiency in spite of compromised folding energetics. Only the most highly destabilized TTR variants are subjected to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and then only in certain tissues_ providing insight into tissue selective amyloidosis. Rather than a "quality control" standard based on wild-type stability_ we find that ER-assisted folding (ERAF)_ based on global protein energetics_ determines the extent of export. We propose that ERAF (influenced by the energetics of the protein fold_ chaperone enzyme distributions_ and metabolite chaperones) in competition with ERAD defines the unique secretory aptitude of each tissue.

For the majority the pain disappears during the first  months after delivery; however_ for a significant number of women_ the pain is persistent_ with little improvement for more than three months after delivery. Moreover_ women who experience persistent lumbopelvic pain three months postpartum are at substantial risk for new episodes or for chronic lumbopelvic pain later in life. Hence_ pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain should be considered a major public health issue. In order to develop and offer specific treatment strategies_ it is important to identify different subgroups of lumbopelvic pain based on different clinical presentations. Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is one of the major subgroups of pain related to pregnancy. There is no consensus regarding the underlying mechanisms although instability in the pelvis has been proposed as one of the possible mechanism; thus_ further studies are necessary to determine how to treat these women. The local lumbopelvic muscle system_ including the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) is thought to contribute to the stabilization of the pelvis and they are also the target for many treatment strategies for lumbopelvic pain.The overall aim of this thesis was to improve rehabilitation for women with persistent postpartum PGP by investigating three areas_ including: 1) the postural response of the PFM_ 2) the effect of home-based specific stabilizing exercises (SSE) that target the local lumbopelvic muscle system and_ 3) predictors for disability at 15 months postpartum.The thesis comprises three studies: A) a methodological study_ B) an experimental study_ and C) a clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT). The data is mainly based on muscle function_ including recordings of electromyographic (EMG) activation_ muscle endurance_ and muscle strength. We also collected subjective ratings of disability_ healthrelated quality of life_ and pain.The methodological study showed that the designed protocol_ which included limb movements performed at a comfortable speed in both standing and supine positions_ was useful for detecting a postural response in the PFM. The experimental study demonstrated that women with persistent postpartum PGP and those free of pain exhibited a feed-forward mechanism in the PFM that responded in anticipation to leg lifts performed in a supine position. However_ we cannot rule out the possibility that women with difficulties in transferring load between the trunk and legs (i.e._ those with functional pelvic instability) might have a different postural response in the PFM. In the present study_ one woman with persistent postpartum PGP failed to present a feed-forward mechanism in the PFM_ in agreement with previous studies on other parameters of the PFM from other similar groups.The clinical RCT demonstrated that the concept of home-based SSE with visits every second week with the treating physiotherapist was not more effective than the clinical natural course for improving subjective ratings or muscle function in women with persistent postpartum PGP.A linear regression analysis revealed a complex picture that suggests that disability 15 months postpartum in women with persistent PGP could be partially predicted by two interaction effects comprising factors from different dimensions: biological_ physical functioning_ and self-rated function. The proposed association between muscle function and PGP was strengthen. New approaches are most likely needed to further identify subgroups of patients with persistent postpartum PGP that can be considered homogeneous for treatment.","Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain and its relation to muscle function"

A regioselective protection-deprotection strategy was used in the synthetic pathway of the other non-commercial esters_ esterification and selective pivaloylation of the less-hindered hydroxyl group of other commercial dihydroxybenzoic acids gave diester intermediates_ which then were O-methylated before methanolysis of the pivaloyl group which yielded the desired non-commercial methyl hydroxy-methoxybenzoates. The five synthesized methyl hydroxy-methoxybenzoic esters were complemented with commercial samples of the five other isomers of methyl hydroxy-methoxybenzoate and spectrometric data were collected for the complete set of isomers. All ten isomers were tested for their antifeedant effect on the pine weevil. The effect varied considerably among the hydroxy-methoxybenzoic esters. Methyl 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate showed the highest effect and may thus be a candidate for practical use in pine weevil pest management.","Hydroxy-methoxybenzoic methyl esters"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu74210_7","Traditionally_ hearing instrument signal processing schemes are evaluated where the speech recognition tests in noise are most sensitive_ i.e. around 50 percent correct. However_ such testing typically leads to ecologically unrealistic negative signal-to-noise ratios. Therefore_ memory performance has been suggested as a more ecologically valid outcome measure in conditions with interfering background noises_ and where participants perform closer to 100 percent correct. In a recent study by Sarampalis et al. (2009) they used an Ephraim-Mallah noise reduction algorithm and found beneficial effects for normal hearing participants on memory function. However_ such memory effects have not been shown for hearing impaired participants. The current study on hearing-impaired subjects evaluated ‘aggressive’ ideal binary masking (IBM_ see Wang_ et al._ 2009)_ as a proof-of-concept not only for improving speech comprehension but also for its potential effects of masking on memory systems. Furthermore_ binary masks estimated from directional microphones (Boldt et al._ 2008) were used as a realistic version of binary mask processing. Results show significant main effects of noise type and noise reduction. Noise reduction techniques improved the memory performance in the four-talker babble background_ while no such improvement was observed in the steady-state noise background. Participants with higher reading span scores performed significantly better in the memory task_ but only in the four-talker babble background.The study demonstrates the binary-masking noise reduction technique helps freeing up cognitive resources and hence enhances memory task performance in the four-talker babble background for hearing-impaired listeners with high reading span performance. The findings suggest that there is a cognitive challenge for the hearing aid industry to improve signal processing options for individuals to improve immediate perception and encoding into memory.","Immediate effects of signal processing on memory systems"

"oai_DiVA_org_miun12670_7","Against the background of past_ recent and future climate change_ the present thesis addresses elevational shifts of alpine treelines in the Swedish Scandes. By definition_ treeline refers to the elevation (m a.s.l.) at a specific site of the upper trees of a specific tree species_ at least 2 m tall.Based on historical records_ the first part of the thesis reports and analyzes the magnitude of treeline displacements for the main trees species (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii_ Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris) since the early 20th century. The study covered a large and heterogeneous region and more than 100 sites. Concurrent with temperature rise by c. 1.4 °C over the past century_ maximum treeline advances of all species amount to about 200 m. That is virtually what should be predicted from the recorded temperature change over the same period of time. Thus_ it appears that under ideal conditions_ treelines respond in close equilibrium with air temperature evolution. However_ over most parts of the landscape_ conditions are not that ideal and treeline upshifts have therefore been much smaller. The main reason for that discrepancy was found to be topoclimatic constraints_ i.e. the combined action of geomorphology_ wind_ snow distribution_ soil depth_ etc._ which over large parts of the alpine landscape preclude treelines to reach their potential thermal limit.Recorded treeline advance by maximum 200 m or so over the past century emerges as a truly anomalous event in late Holocene vegetation history.The second part of the thesis is focused more on long-term changes of treelines and one specific and prevalent mechanism of treeline change. The first part of the thesis revealed that for Picea and Betula_ treeline shift was accomplished largely by phenotypic transformation of old-established stunted and prostrate individuals (krummholz) growing high above the treeline. In obvious response to climate warming over the past century_ such individuals have transformed into erect tree form_ whereby the treeline (as defined here) has risen. As a means for deeper understanding of this mode of positional treeline change_ extant clonal spruces_ growing around the treeline_ were radiocarbon dated from megafossil remains preserved in the soil underneath their canopies. It turned out that Picea abies in particular may attain almost eternal life due to its capability for vegetative reproduction and phenotypic plasticity. Some living clones were in fact inferred to have existed already 9500 years ago_ and have thus persisted at the same spot throughout almost the entire Holocene. This contrasts with other tree species_ which have left no living relicts from the early Holocene_ when they actually grew equally high as the spruce. Thereafter they retracted by more than 300 m in elevation supporting that also on that temporal scale_ treelines are highly responsive to climate change.The early appearance of Picea in the Scandes_ suggests that Picea “hibernated” the last glacial phase much closer to Scandinavia than earlier thought. It has also immigrated to northern Sweden much earlier than the old-established wisdom.The experiences gained in this thesis should constitute essential components of any model striving to the project landscape ecological consequences of possible future climate shifts.","Treeline dynamics in short and long term perspectives"
"oai_DiVA_org_miun13486_7","We describe a new method of detecting electromagnetic radiation_ operating across a broad frequency range and at least up to liquid nitrogen temperatures. The method is based on the excitation of a special type of. p plasma waves - edge magnetoplasmons - in a semiconductor structure with an embedded two-dimensional (2D) electron layer. Irradiation of the sample by electromagnetic waves induces a photovoltage (or a photoresistance) between pairs of contacts to the 2D electron gas_ which oscillates as a function of an applied magnetic field. The amplitude and the period of the oscillations are proportional to the radiation power and the wavelength respectively_ allowing one to use the device as a detector and spectrometer of radiation. Successful operation of such a detector/spectrometer has been experimentally demonstrated in GaAs-AlGaAs quantum-well structures at microwave frequencies from 20 GHz up to similar to150 GHz and at temperatures up to similar to80 K. We do not expect any principal difficulties in extending the operating frequency range into the terahertz region. The sample design is very simple and does not require submicron technology.","New physical principle of detecting electromagnetic radiation"

Ancestral areas were reconstructed by dispersal-vicariance analysis and constrained Bayesian inference. The results suggest that the insular taxa in the Cettia vulcania group are most closely related to Cettia flavolivacea_ and originated from a dispersal by an ancestral population in the Himalayas towards the south_ to the Sunda region. From this population_ a second dispersal along a different route colonized China and northern Vietnam. Hence_ the Chinese taxon intricata and Vietnamese oblita_ currently allocated to C. flavolivacea_ are more closely related to the vulcania group than to the other taxa in the flavolivacea group_ and we propose that they be treated as conspecific with C. vulcania_ restricting C. flavolivacea to Myanmar and the Himalayas.","Phylogeography of Indonesian and Sino-Himalayan region bush warblers (Cettia_ Aves)."

"oai_DiVA_org_su39489_7","According to microessentialism_ it is necessary to resort to microstructure in order to adequately characterise chemical substances such as water. But the thesis has never been properly supported by argument. Kripke and Putnam_ who originally proposed the thesis_ suggest that a so-called stereotypical characterisation is not possible_ whereas one in terms of microstructure is. However_ the sketchy outlines given of stereotypical descriptions hardly support the impossibility claim. On the other hand_ what naturally stands in contrast to microscopic description is description in macroscopic terms_ and macroscopic characterisations of water are certainly possible. This suffices to counter the claim that microdescriptions are necessary. Whether it counters the impossibility claim depends on whether all macroscopic descriptions are stereotypical (stereotypical descriptions presumably being macroscopic). In so far as systematic import of “stereotypical” can be determined_ it would seem not. But some macroscopic characterisations have definite affinity with everyday knowledge_ which presumably stands in conflict with the spirit of the impossibility claim. Since what is characterised are properties expressed by predicates like “is water”_ the necessity of identity has no bearing here_ and matters of interpretation pose problems for claims to the effect that science fixes the extension of “water” as ordinarily understood.","Microessentialism"
"oai_DiVA_org_su47339_7","Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease caused by destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic Langerhans' islets. This destruction is preceded by an infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes called insulitis. This study aims at determining the cellular mechanisms for the autoimmune reaction associated with diabetes development by using transgenic animal models as well as the spontaneously diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice.MHC class II expression on beta cells has been proposed to be a mechanism for the development of insulitis and diabetes. Transgenic mice expressing physiological levels of allogeneic MHC class II on beta cells do not display any sign of neither insulitis nor diabetes_ although they are functionally intolerant to the allogeneic MHC. We demonstrate that this inability to react to the allogeneic MHC class II on beta cells is due to a functional inability of the beta cells to act as antigen-presenting cells. The MHC class II transgenic mice were mated to mice expressing the costimulatory molecule B7-1 on beta cells. Mice expressing both MHC class II and B7-1 on beta cells develop a severe insulitis and diabetes_ while mice lacking either transgene reveal no sign of autoimmunity. This demonstrates that expression of costimulatory molecules can overcome immunological non-recognition.E alpha-transgenic NOD mice are almost completely protected against insulitis and diabetes. This effect can be modulated by mutating the Ea promoter to give a restricted expression of the transgene. These mice are only partially protected against the development of insulitis. By comparing the different degrees of insulitis in three promoter-mutated transgenic lines_ and relating them to the different patterns of I-E expression_ we demonstrate the requirements for I-E expression on primary antigen-presenting cells in order to alleviate NOD insulitis. By mating the promoter-mutated lines to one another we got double-transgenic lines with an expression pattern very close to normal wildtype expression. In spite of this_ none out of three double-transgenic lines were completely protected from insulitis.We therefore conclude that minute differences in I-E expression account for the susceptibility to insulitis seen in the double-transgenic lines.By intracellular immunofluorescence staining for eight different cytokines we demonstrate a biphasic cytokine pattern with early monokine production correlated to an increasing infiltration of the Langerhans' islets_ and Th1 lymphokines produced prior to the development of diabetes_ thus characterising the effector phase with beta-cell destruction. In addition_ we could find abundant production of IL-6 by endocrine cells_ probably as a stress response to the ongoing tissue damage","Murine insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus"
"oai_DiVA_org_su60414_7","The study objective was to investigate the impact of different kinds of organizational changes_ as well as anticipation of such changes_ on work-related stress_ sleep_ recovery and health. It was hypothesized that impaired sleep and recovery increase the adverse health consequences of organizational changes. The data consisted of cross sectional questionnaire data from a random sample of 1_523 employees in the Swedish police force. It could be shown that extensive organizational changes including downsizing or a change in job tasks were associated with a small increase in work stress_ disturbed sleep_ incomplete recovery and health complaints. However_ less extensive organizational changes like relocation did not affect these outcome variables. Anticipation of extensive organizational changes had almost the same effect as actual changes. Furthermore a moderating effect of sleep and work stress on gastrointestinal complaints and depressive symptoms was found. Thus_ like former studies already suggested_ extensive organizational changes resulted in increased stress levels_ poorer health and impaired sleep and recovery. Furthermore_ organizational instability due to anticipation of changes was as negative as actual changes. There was also some evidence that disturbed sleep increased these adverse health effects_ in particular with respect to anticipation of organizational changes.","The impact of organizational changes on work stress_ sleep_ recovery and health"

The model is a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium setup with a continuum of regions. Thus_ it is a full stochastic general-equilibrium version of RICE_ Nordhauss pioneering multi-region integrated assessment model. Like RICE_ our model features traded fossil fuel but otherwise has no markets across regionsthere is no insurance nor any intertemporal trade across them. The extreme form of market incompleteness is not fully realistic but arguably not a bad approximation of reality. Its major advantage is that_ along with a set of reasonable assumptions on preferences_ technology_ and nature_ it allows a closed-form model solution. We use the model to assess the welfare consequences of carbon taxes that differ across as well as within oil-consuming and -producing regions. We show that_ surprisingly_ only taxes on oil producers can improve the climate: taxes on oil consumers have no effect at all.

Research on cumulative traumas has been lacking_ but Finkelhor (Child Abuse Negl 31:7–26_ 2007) has recently directed the attention to the concept of polyvictimization. As an extension of this concept_ this study examined the impact of polytraumatization_ operationalized as the number of different potentially traumatic events. The study population comprised two cross-sectional samples of school-aged children ( n = 270) and adolescents ( n = 400). Information of life-time incidence of traumatic events was collected by the life incidence of traumatic events (LITE)_ and psychological symptoms by the parent version of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) for the school children and the self-report trauma symptom checklist for children (TSCC) for the adolescents. We found that exposure to at least one traumatic event was common in both the samples (63% of the children and 89.5% of the adolescents). The number of different traumatic events_ polytraumatization_ was highly predictive of symptoms in both samples_ and with a few exceptions surpassed the impact of specific events in exploratory analyses. We furthermore replicated previous findings of the important impact of interpersonal over non-interpersonal events on symptoms in both samples_ and found an indication that this effect differed by gender in different manners in the two samples.

Weakly interacting donor and acceptor groups_ which reorient and interact in a pair wise fashion_ are considered_ under isotropic and anisotropic conditions. For the analysis of experiments it is shown that not only do we need to consider the orientational distributions of the transition dipoles_ but the internal reorienting molecular dynamics within the pair which is of even greater importance. The latter determines the shape as well as the rate of the observed donor fluorescence and depolarisation decays_ which are most often not mono-exponential functions.

Thus_ alternative schedules and drugs have been proposed.OBJECTIVE: To compare BCG to the combination of epirubicin and interferon-alpha2b as adjuvant therapy of T1 tumours.DESIGN_ SETTING_ AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a Nordic multicenter_ prospective_ randomised trial in patients with primary T1 G2-G3 bladder cancer. Initial transurethral resection (TUR) was followed by a second-look resection. Patients were randomised to receive either regimen_ given as induction for 6 wk followed by maintenance therapy for 2 yr.MEASUREMENTS: The drugs were compared with respect to time to recurrence and progression. Also_ side-effects were documented.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 250 patients were randomised. At the primary end point_ 62% were disease free in the combination arm as opposed to 73% in the BCG arm (p=0.065). At 24 mo_ there was a significant difference in favour of the BCG-treated patients (p=0.012) regarding recurrence_ although there was no difference regarding progression. The subgroup analysis showed that the superiority of BCG was mainly in those with concomitant CIS. In a multivariate analysis of association with recurrence/progression status_ significant variables for outcome were type of drug_ tumour size_ multiplicity_ status at second-look resection_ and grade. A corresponding analysis was performed separately in the two treatment arms. Tumour size was the only significant variable for BCG-treated patients_ while multiplicity_ status at second-look resection_ and grade were significant for patients treated with the combination.CONCLUSIONS: For prophylaxis of recurrence_ BCG was more effective than the combination.

In this study_ variation and stability in floral phenological synchronization of all the clones and possible mating pairs_ in terms of an index of phenological overlap_ were observed in a first generation clonal seed orchard which located in northeast of China. Results showed that significant variations occurred in the clones and mating pairs. This kind of variation was apparently related with temperature and humidity of the research site. With increasing age_ levels of flowering synchronization were likely to rise in the clones and mating pairs. In general_ the average flowering synchronization of male parents was slightly higher than that of female parents_ female management in a seed orchard should be paied more attention. Flowering time was under strong genetic control and this genetic control was stronger in the female flowering process than of the males in terms of board sense heritability and year to year correlation analysis. Flowering synchronization of female parents was positively correlated between most years and can be a reliable reference for early and late predication in Pinus tabuliformis seed orchard during stage of initial seed harvest to stable seed production.

"oai_DiVA_org_umu80103_7","Background: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary heart disease with risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Despite our increased knowledge about genotype and phenotype correlation we still rely on the 12-lead ECG for assessment of the QT interval and the T-wave morphology for diagnosis and risk stratification. Intra- and -inter individual variability in manually QT measurement and_ e.g._ difficulties in defining the end of the T-wave may impair the diagnosis of LQTS. Increased heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization (VR) may be an important factor in the arrhythmogenicity in cases of LQTS. In a LQTS founder population the same mutation is carried by numerous individuals in many families which provide a unique opportunity to study diagnostic methods_ risk assessment_ VR and the correlation between genotype and phenotype.Methods: Resting 12-lead ECG and vectorcardiogram (VCG) were recorded in 134 LQTS mutation carriers and 121 healthy controls_ to investigate the capability and precision in measuring the QT interval. For assessment of the VR_ VCG was compared in individuals with mutations in the KCNQ1 and KCNH2 gene. Genealogical and geographic studies were performed in 37 index cases and their relatives to determine if Swedish carriers of the Y111C mutation in the KCNQ1 gene constitute a founder population. To confirm kinship_ haplotype analysis was performed in 26 of the 37 index cases. The age and prevalence of the Y111C mutation were calculated in families sharing a common haplotype.Results: VCG by automatic measurement of the QT interval provided the best combination of sensitivity (90%) and specificity (89%) in the diagnosis of LQTS. VCG showed no consistent pattern of increased VR heterogeneity among KCNQ1 and KCNH2 mutation carriers. Living carriers of the Y111C mutation shared a common genetic (haplotype)_ genealogic and geographic origin. The age of the Y111C mutation was approximately 600 years. The prevalence of living carriers of the Y111C mutation in the mid-northern Sweden was estimated to 1:1_500-3_000.Conclusion: We have shown that VCG provides a valuable contribution to the diagnosis and risk assessment of LQTS in adults and children. No consistent pattern of increased VR heterogeneity was found among the LQTS mutation carriers. The identified Swedish LQTS founder population will be a valuable source to future LQTS research and may contribute to increase our understanding of LQTS and the correlation of phenotype_ genotype and modifying factors.","Long QT syndrome"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu90413_7","Viperin is an interferon-induced protein with a broad antiviral activity. This evolutionary conserved protein contains a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) domain which has been shown in vitro to hold a [4Fe-4S] cluster. We identified tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as a novel target for which human viperin inhibits productionof the viral genome RNA. Wt viperin was found to require ER localization for full antiviral activity and to interact with the cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly factor CIAO1. Radiolabelling in vivo revealed incorporation of Fe-55_ indicative for the presence of an Fe-S cluster. Mutation of the cysteine residues ligating the Fe-S cluster in the central radical SAM domain entirely abolished both antiviral activity and incorporation of Fe-55. Mutants lacking the extreme C-terminal W361 did not interact with CIAO1_ were not matured_ and were antivirally inactive. Moreover_ intracellular removal of SAM by ectopic expression of the bacteriophage T3 SAMase abolished antiviral activity. Collectively_ our data suggest that viperin requires CIAO1 for [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly_ and acts through an enzymatic_ Fe-S cluster- and SAM-dependent mechanism to inhibit viral RNA synthesis.","Viperin is an iron-sulfur protein that inhibits genome synthesis of tick-borne encephalitis virus via radical SAM domain activity"

RVIT and RVOT fractional shortening were increased in females (P &lt; 0.01 for both).CONCLUSION: In a cohort of normal individuals_ age has significant impact on RV structure and function_ inlet area falls and outflow tract dimensions increase and fractional shortening also increase in females. In addition_ RVOT wall thickness significantly increases and Doppler markers of pulmonary vascular resistance show a consistent rise. The age-related changes should carefully be considered when commenting on normality and when using absolute values.","The normal impact of age and gender on right heart structure and function"

Besides yellow fever virus_ a landmark case in the history of virology_ members of the Flavivirus genus_ such as West Nile virus and dengue virus_ are increasingly gaining attention due to their re-emergence and incidence in different areas of the world. Additional environmental and demographic considerations suggest that novel or known flaviviruses will continue to emerge in the future. Nevertheless_ up to few years ago flaviviruses were considered low interest candidates for drug design. At the start of the European Union VIZIER Project_ in 2004_ just two crystal structures of protein domains from the flaviviral replication machinery were known. Such pioneering studies_ however_ indicated the flaviviral replication complex as a promising target for the development of antiviral compounds. Here we review structural and functional aspects emerging from the characterization of two main components (NS3 and NS5 proteins) of the flavivirus replication complex. Most of the reviewed results were achieved within the European Union VIZIER Project_ and cover topics that span from viral genomics to structural biology and inhibition mechanisms. The ultimate aim of the reported approaches is to shed light on the design and development of antiviral drug leads.","Structure and functionality in flavivirus NS-proteins"

In Study 1_ the speech of social phobics was recorded in an anxiogenic public speaking task both before and after treatment. In Study 2_ the speech material was collected from real life human-computer interactions. All speech samples were acoustically analyzed and subjected to listening tests. Results from Study 1 showed that a decrease in experienced state anxiety after treatment was accompanied by corresponding decreases in a) several acoustic parameters (i.e._ mean and maximum F0_ proportion of high-frequency components in the energy spectrum_ and proportion of silent pauses)_ and b) listeners’ perceived level of nervousness. Both speakers’ self-ratings of state anxiety and listeners’ ratings of perceived nervousness were further correlated with similar acoustic parameters. Results from Study 2 revealed that mean and maximum F0_ mean voice intensity and H1-H2 was higher for speech perceived as irritated than for speech perceived as neutral. Also_ speech perceived as resigned had lower mean and maximum F0_ and mean voice intensity than neutral speech. Listeners’ ratings of irritation_ resignation and emotion intensity were further correlated with several acoustic parameters. The results complement earlier studies on vocal affect expression which have been conducted on posed_ rather than authentic_ emotional speech.","Vocal expression in spontaneous and experimentally induced affective speech"

The amalgams were common pools and the municipalities had incentives to free-ride on their amalgam partners by increasing debt prior to amalgamation. We find that municipalities that merged in 1952 increased their debt between 1948 and 1952 when the reform could be anticipated. The increase amounted to 52% of new debt issued or 1.5% of total revenues in the merged municipalities. But contrary to the “law of 1/n”_ free-riding did not increase in common pool size.","Merged municipalities_ higher debt: on free-riding and the common pool problem in politics"

These jets can have a dynamic pressure much larger than the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. On 17 March 2007_ several jets of this type were observed by the Cluster spacecraft. We study in detail these jets and their effects on the magnetopause_ the magnetosphere_ and the ionospheric convection. We find that (1) the jets could have a scale size of up to a few RE but less than similar to 6 R-E transverse to the XGSE axis; (2) the jets caused significant local magnetopause perturbations due to their high dynamic pressure; (3) during the period when the jets were observed_ irregular pulsations at the geostationary orbit and localised flow enhancements in the ionosphere were detected. We suggest that these inner magnetospheric phenomena were caused by the magnetosheath jets.","Supermagnetosonic subsolar magnetosheath jets and their effects"

All women were provoked by intra-pelvic palpation of 13 predetermined intra-pelvic landmarks. The provoked pain distribution was expressed in pain drawings and the pain intensity verbally on a Likert scale.Also_ in a randomised controlled trial the 36 women with chronic pelvic pain were allocated to bilateral injection treatment with either triamcinolone or saline solutions_ given once on the ischial spine with follow-up after four weeks.Results: Referred pain provoked on intra-pelvic landmarks follows a specific pattern. In general_ pain provoked by palpation of the posterior intra-pelvic landmarks was mostly referred to the sacral region and pain provoked by palpation of the ischial and pubic bones was mostly referred to the groin and pubic regions. In women with chronic pelvic pain the provoked pain distribution area and pain intensity were magnified as compared to women without chronic pelvic pain.In the clinical trial decreased pain intensity_ decreased distribution of pain and improved physical function was achieved among the triamcinolone treatment group as compared to the saline treatment group. Also_ a positive correlation was shown between reduced pain intensity and improved function.Conclusions: Referred pain patterns provoked on intra-pelvic landmarks in women with chronic pelvic pain persisting after childbirth are consistent with sclerotomal sensory innervations and indicates allodynia and central sensitisation. This suggests that pain mapping can be used to evaluate and confirm the pain experience and contribute to diagnosis. Also_ the pain intensity provoked by stimulation of the intra-pelvic landmarks is suggested to be useful to differentiate women with chronic pelvic pain from those without. Corticosteroid treatment to the ischial spine resulted in decreased pain and increased function.","Chronic Pelvic Pain Persisting after Childbirth"

Up to 60% of the α2-cells exhibited spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations (frequency 0.1–0.3/min) in a medium containing 3 mM glucose. In originating from a basal level of 60–100 nM_ reaching peak values of 300–400 nM and promptly disappearing after blocking voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with methoxyverapamil_ the oscillations resembled those in insulin-releasing β-cells stimulated by glucose. The oscillatory activity was suppressed when combining elevation of glucose to 20 mM with the addition of 2–2000 ng/ml insulin. Whereas 10 mM of l-arginine or l-glycine transformed the oscillations into sustained elevation of [Ca2+];_ there was no response to 1 mM tolbutamide or 0.1–1 mM γ-aminobutyric acid. The observations that α2-cells differ from islet cells secreting insulin and somatostatin in responding to adrenaline with mobilisation of intracellular calcium can be used for their rapid identification. It is suggested that the oscillations reflect periodic entry of Ca2+ due to variations of the membrane potential.","Suppression of Ca2+ oscillations in glucagon-producing alfa2-cells by insulin/glucose and amino acids"

The upregulation of the former protein is a well-known phenomenon_ whereas the retinoid-induced regulation of epidermal keratin expression is more complex and only partially understood. We studied the effect of topical retinoids on the expression in healthy skin of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II_ tazarotene-induced genes 1 and 2_ several epidermal keratins (K1_ K2e_ and K10)_ and two mucous keratins (K4 and K13) known to appear in epidermis under certain abnormal conditions. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that the K4 expression was the one most overtly induced by 2 wk of open treatment with 0.05% of retinoic acid and tazarotene. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan) and normalization of the mRNA values to beta-actin_ the increase in K4 was found to be 100-1000-fold. In comparison_ the expression of K13 and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II was increased 10-50-fold_ the K1 and K10 mRNA levels remained unchanged_ and the K2e level decreased by a factor of 100-1000. In parallel biopsies_ immunohistochemistry showed no change in K1_ K2e_ or K10 staining_ but a strong de novo appearance of K4 in the granular layer after retinoid treatment. In a separate study_ occlusive application of 0.025% retinoic acid in four healthy subjects produced a maximal K4 mRNA signal after 48 h and strong K4 staining after 80 h. Finally_ a dose-response study showed that the de novo appearance of K4 can be utilized as a sensitive test for retinoid bioactivity in epidermis in vivo.","Keratin 4 upregulation by retinoic acid in vivo"

The objective was to explore possible significant synergistic effects obtained from the combination of these different substrates. The performance of the process was assessed in thermophilic anaerobic batch co-digestion assays_ using a four factor mixture design and methane yield (Y-CH4) and specific methane production rate (r(scH4)) as response variables. The highest methane yield_ 655 NmL CH4/g VS was obtained when equal parts (ww) of SB_ M_ VC_ and MSW were combined_ while the combination of SB_ M_ and MSW resulted in the highest specific methane production rate (43 NmL CH4/g VS/d). A mixture design model was fitted to data in order to appraise synergistic and antagonistic interactions. Mixing all four substrates resulted in a 31% increase of the expected yield which was calculated from the methane potential of the individual fractions_ clearly demonstrating a synergistic effect due to more balanced nutrient composition enhancing the anaerobic digestion process. However_ no significant antagonistic effects were observed. In order to maximize both response variables simultaneously_ a response surface method was employed to establish the optimal combination of substrate mixtures. The statistical results and analysis of the biological process gave a coherent picture of the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

High levels of boring bar vibration generally occur at frequencies related to the first two fundamental bending modes of a boring bar. This is the first of two companion papers that summarize the theoretical and experimental work carried out concerning modeling of dynamic properties of boring bars. This paper introduces the Timoshenko beam theory for the modeling of clamped boring bars. Also_ the traditional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is applied. These continuous system methods have been utilized to produce fixed-free beam models of the clamped boring bar. In order to improve accuracy of dynamic models of clamped boring bars_ the modeling of the boring bar clamping is addressed by means of multi-span beam models with pinned boundary conditions. The derived boring bar models have also been compared with results obtained by means of experimental modal analysis_ conducted on the actual boring bar clamped in a lathe. The multi-span beam boring bar models display higher correlation with experimental modal analysis results as compared to fixed-free beam models. For the fixed-free beams the Timoshenko model results in the highest correlation with the experimental results. On the other hand_ the interval in frequency and the orientation of the two fundamental modes demonstrate differences_ particularly between the continuous system models and the experimental results.","Dynamic Modeling of a Boring Bar Using Theoretical and Experimental Engineering Methods Part 1"

A total of 357 patients were included. The mean age was 63 years_ and 72% were males. The patients were asked to answer the HAD scale (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) six times during 1 year. The number of possible or probable cases of anxiety or depression disorder was calculated according to standardized cut-offs. Approximately one-third of the patients scored as a possible or probable case of a major mood disorder at each measurement point during the study year. There were new cases of anxiety or depression at each time point. The anxiety level was highest at diagnosis_ while depression was most common during treatment. Females were more anxious than males at diagnosis_ and patients under 65 years of age scored higher than those over 65. Patients with lower performance status and more advanced disease reported higher levels of mental distress and more often scored as a probable or possible cases of psychiatric disorder. Our psychometric analyses supported the two-dimensional structure and stability of the HAD scale. The HAD scale seems to be the method of choice for getting valid information about the probability of mood disorder in head and neck cancer populations. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity found in this study emphasizes the importance of improved diagnosis and treatment.","A prospective multicentre study in Sweden and Norway of mental distress and psychiatric morbidity in head and neck cancer patients"

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_118166_7","OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the association between occupational and hobby exposure and the risk of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) while focusing on differential patterns of clonal chromosome aberrations and morphologic subgroups. METHODS: A case-referent study was conducted with 330 MDS patients investigated cytogenetically in 1976-1993 (cases) and matched referents. Telephone interviews with either the person or a next-of-kin were used. The participation rate of the cases and referents was 85% and 60%_ respectively. Information was obtained from the next-of-kin more often for the cases (88%) than for the referents (26%). Occupational hygienists assessed the exposure using interview data on worktasks and hobbies. Associations with disease risk were evaluated for 10 exposures with a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The investigated exposures were generally not associated with cytogenetically abnormal MDS. Effect estimates for specific cytogenetic or morphologic subgroups were generally imprecise. Occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (EMF) was associated with MDS with a normal karyotype odds ratio (OR) 2.0_ 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-4.0. The exposure-response association was consistent for intensity but inconclusive for duration. A decreased risk was observed for MDS_ irrespective of karyotypic pattern_ among farmers and farmhands (OR 0.53_ 95% CI 0.35-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetically abnormal MDS was generally not associated with occupational or hobby exposure to known or suspected genotoxic agents. However_ exposure prevalences and intensities were low for several agents. An association was suggested between occupational exposure to EMF and MDS with a normal karyotype. Biases due to differential information quality and selective participation cannot be ruled out.","Cytogenetic and morphologic subgroups of myelodysplastic syndromes in relation to occupational and hobby exposures."

Next of kin is important in reducing intensive care patients' fear and anxiety. However_ admission to an intensive care unit is often recognised as an extremely stressful event_ causing next of kin to experience shock_ fear_ anxiety and vulnerability. More knowledge is needed about how next of kin in intensive care can be empowered. Design. The study was conducted using a phenomenological method. Methods. Ten interviews were conducted with intensive care patients' next of kin. Findings. Perceptions of both a genuine will and a capacity to help and relieve were found to be essential for next of kin's experiences of empowerment in an intensive care situation. All informants were empowered by a caring atmosphere where they received continuous_ straightforward and honest information that left room for hope and in which closeness to the patient was facilitated and medical care was perceived as the best possible. Some of the informants were also strengthened by support from other family members and/or by being involved in caring for the patient. Conclusions. Next of kin empowerment was found to be associated with being met with human warmth and sensitivity. This emphasises the importance of discussing attitudes and behaviours as well as surveillance and treatment when trying to improve the care of next of kin in intensive care unit and when working with staff development. Relevance to clinical practice. Knowledge of how to empower next of kin in an intensive care situation allows caring staff to support these persons in a more sensitive and appropriate way. Findings underline the importance of creating caring relations with patients' next of kin.","Empowerment from the perspective of next of kin in intensive care"

The Managed Ventricular Pacing (MVP) mode has been shown to significantly reduce the percent ventricular pacing compared to the DDD/R mode. This study assessed the percent of ventricular pacing in a standard pacemaker population programmed to MVP and for which patients it is possible to achieve a Cum%VP &lt;= 40%. Methods and results Unselected_ consecutive patients were implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker with a mean follow-up period of 76 days. The Cum%VP was calculated from device diagnostics between pre-hospital discharge (PHD) and the 1-month post implant visit. The median Cum%VP of 107 patients (age 67.2 +/- 14 years; 53% mate) who were programmed to MVP was 3.9%. The median Cum%VP was 1.4% in patients with sinus node disease (SND) and 28.8% in patients with AV block (AVB). Cum%VP &lt;= 40% was observed in 72% of all. patients_ in 50% of AVB patients_ and in 86% of SND patients. Conclusion The MVP mode is capable of achieving a tow percent of ventricular pacing in a standard pacemaker population with SND and AVB.

But there are nocturnal and crepuscular insects - such as some species of bees_ wasps and butterflies - that have apposition compound eyes. These are likely to have adaptations - including large eye and facet size and coarsened spatial and temporal resolution - that improve their sensitivity and thus their visual reliability. Is this also true for crepuscular insects that are active at intermediate intensities? To test this hypothesis_ the visual performance of two closely related butterflies_ the diurnal blue morpho Morpho peleides and the crepuscular owl butterfly Caligo memnon_ were compared. Compared to the diurnal M. peleides_ the crepuscular C. memnon does not appear to be adapted to a nocturnal lifestyle in terms of spatial resolution: the interommatidial angle Delta is similar in both species_ and acceptance angles_ Deltarho_ are only marginally larger in C. memnon. Moreover_ temporal resolution is only a little coarser in C. memnon compared to M. peleides. Using a model for sensitivity_ we found that the eyes of C. memnon are about four times as light-sensitive as those of M. peleides in the frontal visual field_ much of this difference being due to the larger facet diameters found in C. memnon. In summary_ greater visual sensitivity has evolved in C. memnon than in M. peleides_ showing that adaptations that improve sensitivity can be found not only in nocturnal apposition eyes_ but also on a smaller scale in crepuscular apposition eyes.","Visual sensitivity in the crepuscular owl butterfly Caligo memnon and the diurnal blue morpho Morpho peleides: a clue to explain the evolution of nocturnal apposition eyes?"

Mechanical properties_ oxidation_ and wear properties of UHMWPE materials subjected to various thermal treatments have been investigated immediately after irradiation as well as after several years of aging. Nevertheless_ the relationship between all these parameters is not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the thermal treatments that could be applied to irradiated UHMWPE lower (60) or higher (150) than 140°C_ the melting temperature of the polymer and the mechanical properties_ the oxidation and the fracture behavior of the material. The effect of artificial aging on these properties was also investigated. This study concludes that immediately after the annealing_ the mechanical properties (UTS and ) of the irradiated and annealed material are improved compared with those of nonirradiated material. Although nonirradiated material has higher fracture toughness than irradiated and annealed materials_ the materials break according to the same mechanism of fracture. After aging_ no changes could be observed in any of the measured properties for nonirradiated material. On the other hand_ important changes could be seen in both irradiated and annealed material after aging. Both UTS and decreased_ much more so in the case of 60. Furthermore_ the aging induced a subsurface peak of oxidation in both irradiated and annealed materials_ twice as intense for 60 than for 150. The mechanism of fracture of these materials changed drastically after aging_ probably due to the presence of the oxidation peak_ which seems to occur at a location where cracks initiate easily compared with the nonoxidized bulk of the material. In the case of 60_ it seems clear that a correlation between mechanical property_ oxidation_ and fracture mechanism exists. Such a relationship could not be found for 150. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals_ Inc.","The effect of irradiation_ annealing temperature_ and artificial aging on the oxidation_ mechanical properties_ and fracture mechanisms of UHMWPE."

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1227759_7","The traditional restrictive attitude towards claim for compensation about non-pecuniary harms in both cause law and legislation become weaker even if the theoretically and practically reason behind the old exception-construction remain. This reason can best be explained by the thesis about incommensurability when it comes to compensate for some losses that money cannot compensate. To explain why the exception-construction is problemized in recent days I think two circumstances has played an important role (1) the materialisation of human rights as a consequence of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Sweden since 1995 and (2) the right to crime victim compensation and the establishing of victimology in the legal and academic field. In practice there is of course a co-operation between these two factors and there is also some kind of hybrids like the legal interest of for example discrimination. This tendency is in my opinion therefore a practical and concrete example of law and justice in the risk society where almost every person is a potential victim of crimes and discrimination or other violations. In the risk society_ given Ulrich Beck’s definition_ it is characteristic that these phenomenons in our society rub out the boarders between law and politics in the manifestation of reflexive subpolitics about flexibility. The possibility to obtain redress with this compensation function as a mean to support the judicial systems official goal that is to satisfied the citizens needs and at the same time secure the confidence and the legitimacy for the judicial system through the factors (1) legal security and (2) the legal rights of the individual. At the same time these compensations bring on inherent risks because of its unclear function and the incommensurability between injury and compensation that risks fall upon both the victims and the lawyer’s profession. So when human rights now is both a goal and a mean for democracy and violations of the citizens bring about a right to compensation this illustrate a paradox. The judicial system cannot handle this type of injury that has it is ground in public law without challenge traditional principles and the legal professionalism. This tendency is also interesting in a comparative perspective given the premise that the jurisprudence movement known as Scandinavian Legal Realism has had an influence on the Swedish judicial culture. This follows from two circumstances: (1) Given the Scandinavian Legal Realism it is impossible to set up a legal claim from a violation of justice or somebody’s rights and (2) even if it would be possible_ it is impossible to imagine the basis of calculation of these compensation because there is no way for informal norms from the society to influence the formal legal norms and the application of the law (only the opposite) given the Scandinavian Legal Realism. The last circumstance is relevant because the compensation of non-pecuniary harms consist of incommensurability and the only way to calculate these compensation_ so it make it serves as rectification or redress for the victim_ is in reflection and influence of the informal norms or the “common sense of justice”. My topic presupposes that the legal field is influenced by the theory in jurisprudence and can we therefore talk about an idealistic tendency or “critical legal realist” movement that maybe illustrates in these compensations. In a more concrete perspective these compensations bring to the fore methodological question in social science of how we can get empirically knowledge about norms in our society.","Non-Pecuniary (Idealistic) Damages in Tort.

Since it is not possible to investigate this influence by taking repeated exposures of the same patients on films with systematically varied H/D curves_ patient images of lumbar spine were digitised in the current study. The image contrast was altered by digital image processing techniques_ simulating images with H/D curves varying from flat over standard latitude to a film type steeper than a mammography film. The manipulated images were printed on film for evaluation. Seven European radiologists evaluated the clinical image quality of in total 224 images by analysing the fulfilment of the European Image Criteria and by visual grading analysis of the images. The results show that the local quality can be significantly improved by the application of films with a steeper film H/D curve compared to the standard latitude film. For images with an average optical density of about 1.25_ the application of the steeper film results in a reduction of patient absorbed dose by about 10-15% without a loss of diagnostically relevant image information. The results also show that the patient absorbed dose reduction obtained by altering the tube voltage from 70 kV to 90 kV coincides with a loss of image information that cannot be compensated for by simply changing the shape of the H/D curve.","The influence of the characteristic curve on the clinical image quality and patient absorbed dose in lumbar spine radiography"

Earlier studies have interpreted a more frequent use of requests of confirmation (yes/no interrogatives) in the CI group as a conversational strategy used to prevent communication breakdowns and control the development of the conversation. This study provides a continuation of this line of research_ now focusing on responses to requests for clarification. Aims: The aim was to examine the type and distribution of responses to requests for clarification in a referential communication task. In addition_ we analysed the compliance between the type of response and the type of request as a measure of mutual adaptation. Methods &amp; Procedures: Twenty-six conversational pairs aged 10-19 years participated: 13 pairs consisting of a child/adolescent with CI (CI) and a conversational partner (CIP); and 13 pairs consisting of a normally hearing control (NH) and a conversational partner (NHP). The pairs performed a referential communication task requiring the description of faces. All occurrences of requests for clarification and their responses in the dialogues were identified and categorized. We also analysed how the different types of requests and responses were combined and the type-conformity of the responses to requests for confirmation. Outcomes &amp; Results: The results showed no significant group differences regarding type_ distribution or type-conformity of responses. In all four groups (CI_ CIP_ NH and NHP)_ a discrepancy between the request and the response was found_ indicating that the response provided information that was not explicitly requested. Requests for confirmation constituted 78-90% of the requests_ whereas only 54-61% of responses were confirmations. Conversely_ the proportion of requests for elaboration was 6-15%_ whereas the proportion of elaborated responses was 34-40%. Conclusions &amp; Implications: The children/adolescents with CI contribute equally to the conversation regarding type and distribution of responses to requests for clarification. The frequent use of elaborated responses indicates common ground for the conversational partners and a shared understanding of the objective of the task. The context creates facilitative conditions_ with positive interactional consequences.

However_ one can also find examples of clauses introduced by plus(s) at(t) although not preceded by another at(t)-clause. These constructions_ which represent a relatively new development in Scandinavian_ are semantically similar to coordinations containing two embedded clauses: in either case two propositions are coordinated. But syntactically they are of course different. The proposal is that the whole plus(s) at(t)-construction is a main clause where plus(s) represents the matrix clause while the subjunction that follows introduces an ordinary embedded clause. It also seems to be the case that other elements besides plus(s) can function as one-word matrix clauses. Some of these elements would normally be analysed as interjections; others are verb-like while still others are adjectives. In addition_ the conjunction men ‘but’ appears to be able to have this function. What all the minimal matrix clauses have in common is that they are related to the illocutionary force of the utterance. For some of the minimal matrix elements it can be shown that they spell out only a small part of the matrix clause_ as adverbials can be added. For other elements_ like plus(s) and men_ it is unclear whether they represent clauses that have a full clause structure or clause that are truly minimal even syntactically.","Plus(s) at(t) i skandinaviska — en minimal matris."
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1584457_7","This thesis has two main objectives. The first is to analyse the potential of existing assessment tools and methods to incorporate the different dimensions of sustainability in an assessment. The second is to apply some of these tools in a case study in order to determine how forest sector can better contribute to sustainable development in Estonia. The first aim is addressed in a theoretical section that provides an overview and categorization of the existing tools and methods for assessing sustainability. In the case study a transition analysis of the forest sector’s development over the last 20 years is performed together with a stakeholder analysis to determine the potential for improvements. Furthermore_ a scenario analysis using a computer simulation in a life cycle perspective is performed to determine the sustainability impacts of the two sustainable forestry visions defined by Estonian forest stakeholders. The results revealed that even though the majority of tools and methods are non-integrated and thus not suitable for assessing sustainability in its broad sense_ they can be combined in order to gain increased coverage of a variety of scales and integration of wider range of domains. Transition analysis revealed that Estonian forest sector has undergone rapid economic development with strong pressure on environment. There has also been a considerable drop in economic profitability_ but an increase in sustainability-oriented initiatives. The modelling results revealed that current definition of sustainable forestry leads to a continuous separation of environmental and socio-economic aspects. It can be concluded that the Estonian forest sector faces two main sustainability challenges a) increasing the sustainability in private forests_ and b) balancing the duality embedded in the definition of sustainable forestry applied in Estonia. Increasing certification_ improving the woodland key habitat contracting system_ empowering the non-harvesting private forest owners_ identification of the needs and preferences of forest owners_ a concretisation of the sustainable forestry definition_ and implementation of clear_ measurable long-term goals together with periodic assessment of progress toward sustainability are some of the suggestions proposed to increase the sustainability in the forest sector.","The Estonian forest sector in transition to sustainability?

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_27636_7","The aim of this thesis is to argue for the definition of the German present tense as a non-past tense. Three descriptive levels are distinguished: the semantic_ the conceptual and the &quot;level of reality&quot; ( &quot;Wirklichkeitsebene&quot; ). It is assumed that there is no 1:1 correspondence between the semantic and the conceptual level. The former divides time into two temporal spheres: the past and the non-past_ while the conceptual levei consists of three parts: past_ present and future time. The semantic structure of the present tense ( Nichtvergangenheitsbereich ) depicts two of them_ i.e. present and future time. The Nichtvergangenheitsbereich indicates to which section on the time scale the utterance refers to. This section can be further restricted by i.a. time adverbials (at the semantic level) or by context. In a speech situation_ the time of utterance is associated with the conceptual sphere of present time. The description of the present tense as a non-past tense does not imply that the situation described is fully included into the non-past sphere. The only restriction is that the situation cannot be regarded as entirely belonging to the past. A specific component of this present tense model is the term Zeitbild (image of time) which represents the speaker&#39;s/hearer&#39;s knowledge as regards the time at which the situation takes place. This knowledge_ which need not be identical with the objective time of the situation described_ determines the choice of tense. In particular_ the explanation of the present tense combined with a time adverbial_ such as heute_ dieses Jahr _ benefits from the distinction between Zeitbild and objective time. The analysis of this combination is based on a large number of empirical data. Several uses of the present tense for past situations_ e.g. historical present_ are regarded as temporally marked. The situation referred to is seen as an object existing in the speaker&#39;s here and now ( Bildfunktion ). Finally_ present tense in indirect speech is dealt with. In indirect speech some ungrammatical combinations of present tense and adverbials denoting past time like gestern _ constitute additional support for the hypothesis that the German present tense is a non-past tense.","Das deutsche Präsens : Tempus der Nichtvergangenheit"

Here_ we review recent studies reporting new disease-specific prognostic markers_ in addition to allogeneic-HSCT-related risk factors_ which can be assessed at specific time points during treatment. We propose risk assessment as a dynamic process during treatment_ incorporating both disease-related and transplant-related factors for the decision to proceed either to allogeneic HSCT or to apply a nontransplant strategy. We suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be favoured if the projected disease-free survival is expected to improve by at least 10% based on an individual&#39;s risk assessment. The approach requires initial disease risk assessment_ identifying a sibling or unrelated donor soon after diagnosis and the incorporation of time-dependent risk factors_ all within the context of an integrated therapeutic management approach.","The European LeukemiaNet AML Working Party consensus statement on allogeneic HSCT for patients with AML in remission: an integrated-risk adapted approach"

Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induced endothelial cells to undergo EndMT_ whereas bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP-7) preserved the endothelial phenotype. The systemic administration of recombinant human BMP-7 (rhBMP-7) significantly inhibited EndMT and the progression of cardiac fibrosis in mouse models of pressure overload and chronic allograft rejection.

"oai_services_scigloo_org_101080_7","Decentralisation and deregulation in Swedish secondary education has put more responsibility on local school organization to manoeuvre in a competitive educational context. Political claims foregoing this form of quasimarket development in education stress enhanced opportunities for choices and stimulation of pluralistic interests among students inside a more autonomous school organization. In this paper the issue of educational opportunities is underlined by discussing initial results from an ongoing fieldwork at a Swedish secondary school. Shaped as a case study_ the purpose is to investigate how students at both academic and vocational study programmes view their future opportunities in a wider socioeconomic context. More specifically the purpose is to examine how sociocultural conditions become decisive for evaluating possibilities and restraints of schooling. The methodological approach uses multiple qualitative methods_ and is inspired by theoretical perspectives that underline the interconnection between individual_ organization and society. Emphasis is in particular put on how individual choices are shaped_ mediated and channelled by institutional conditions. A theoretical elaboration will be tested by using Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of Habitus_ as socially embodied structures_ that can be viewed upon as a mediating link between individual action and external power relations of the society. Preliminary results indicate that educational objectives set by the school in question are interpreted rather differently by the vocational and academic students. Individual perception of opportunities coincides with norms and values in the local cultural environment_ and results in individual strategies that overlap with local collective beliefs. Both academic and vocational students pursue instrumental goals of material security and social establishment. However_ the difference tends to lie in collectively tied practices of pursuing and defining those aims. At the academic oriented programmes school objectives are commonly agreed upon_ and are incorporated in the cultural environment. Conversely_ mistrust and disagreement towards the goals of the vocational programme seems to prevail among the students. Organisational strategies are shifting in accordance to these different goals_ respectively. From supportive and dialog-oriented conduct at the academic track_ to conflict filled and disciplining relations at the vocational programme. These early results indicate that students need to take an active part in the specific cultural setting with explicit notions of consistency in order to allocate organizational resources to their favour. Moreover_ this case study demonstrate the increasing strong tendency that education is becoming a kind of quasi-market_ which presupposes well-informed and ambitious students who seeks to utilise the gains in schooling. Hence_ this illuminates the importance of further examination of how sociocultural structures condition students’ practical understanding of the possibilities and limitations of education.","Decentralized responsibility and individual liability: A case study of education opportunities in Swedish upper secondary education"

Steels with a pearlitic microstructure are commonly used for wheels due to their height strength_ low cost and good wear properties. However_ the pearlitic microstructure and behaviour can be altered by thermal and mechanical load being present in the contact between wheel and rail. As very high power is available_ a few milliseconds of time where the slip between wheel and rail becomes large can cause small material volumes in the contact to be heated several hundred degrees Celsius. The present work was initiated with the main purpose to investigate the effects of rapid thermal heating and cooling on wheel material. Cyclic and monotonic mechanical testing was performed to study the effects of thermal softening on virgin wheel material and on used wheels taken out from service. Furthermore_ material in both pearlitic and martensitic state was investigated during rapid heating and cooling cycles by methods as laser and resistive heating for different loading conditions. It was shown that alloying composition of different wheel steels could decrease sensitivity to thermal loads_ while plastic deformation had the opposite effect when the material was subjected to long time thermal loading. For the typically very short heating times present in the wheel rail interface no significant permanent effects on mechanical properties were measured for pearlitic material. However_ for martensitic material_ substantial permanent hardness decrease progressed within fractions of a second at elevated temperature. This rapid tempering behaviour was observed to progress even faster in the presence of an external load. Moreover_ the inherent different behaviours of pearlite and martensite can result in different residual stress fields for the case of local heating on the tread surface_ affected by heating rate_ peak temperature and duration. Some additional effects of frictional heating and the influence of wear debris within cracks for rolling contact fatigue cracks were also investigated by use of image and chemical analysis.","Influence of thermal loading on mechanical properties of railway wheel steels"

"oai_services_scigloo_org_154299_7","With thermoelectric materials it is possible to convert a difference in temperature into electrical energy. This can be utilized for a more efficient use of available energy_ eg. by converting waste heat from a combustion process. Based on recent theoretical predictions_ there is a renewed interest to find and develop new and more efficient thermoelectric materials_ improving this potential even further. To do this the thermoelectric properties_ thermopower_ electrical and thermal conductivity_ must be optimized. There are a number of possible ways to achieve this_ among them nanostructuring to reduce thermal conductivity_ doping to improve electrical properties and crystal structure optimization to potentially improve all properties. For this_ it is essential to have the appropriate tools for accurate characterization of these material properties. Thermoelectric properties may be determined using different analytic techniques and it is therefore important that these are compared to assess their level of agreement. Synthesis and characterization of new thermoelectric materials have been the aim of this thesis. Work to improve the thermoelectric properties of Ba8Ga16Ge30 and Mg2Si through substitution and nanoinclusions have been performed as well as studies of the thermal stability of p-type Ba8Ga16Ge30. It is shown that p-type Ba8Ga16Ge30 is not stable above 400°C_ in fact it is possible to change the doping from p- to n-type through thermal treatment of the material. Substituting Ge with Zn in n-type Ba8Ga16Ge30 results in slight improvement of ZT in the low to intermediate temperature range_ which likely could be further improved with optimization of the system. With TiO2 nanoparticles added to Ba8Ga16Ge30 some improvements of ZT were recorded and a complex effect on the charge carrier concentration in the material was observed. The thermoelectric properties of Mg2Si were improved after addition of TiO2 nanoparticles_ even though TiO2 was completely reduced or reacted to metallic Ti and TiSi2. The charge carrier concentration of the titanium-containing Mg2Si material was improved_ likely through doping of the material. The Laser Flash (LFA) and Transient Plane Source (TPS) techniques for thermal conductivity measurements have been evaluated and compared. The methods were concluded to be comparable_ with the TPS technique requiring larger sample specimens for materials with high thermal conductivity and the LFA method sometimes suffers from with compromised surface coating and only indirectly measuring thermal conductivity.","Synthesis and Characterization of New Inorganic Thermoelectric Materials"

Previous findings have indicated greater metabolic risk in children with high intakes of solid hydrogenated fat and white bread_ and low consumption of fruits_ vegetables and dairy products. What this study adds In a large multinational sample of 2 to 9 years old children_ high consumption of sweetened beverages and low intake of nuts and seeds_ sweets_ breakfast cereals_ jam and honey and chocolate and nut-based spreads were directly associated with increased clustered cardiovascular disease risk. These findings add new evidence to the limited literature available in young populations on the role that diet may play on cardiovascular health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate food consumption in relation to clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. METHODS: Children (n = 5548_ 51.6% boys) from eight European countries participated in the IDEFICS study baseline survey (2007-2008). Z-scores of individual CVD risk factors were summed to compute sex- and age-specific (2-<6 years/6-9 years) clustered CVD risk scores A (all components_ except cardiorespiratory fitness) and B (all components). The association of clustered CVD risk and tertiles of food group consumption was examined. RESULTS: Odds ratio (OR) of having clustered CVD risk A increased in older children with higher consumption of chocolate and nut-based spreads (boys: OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.32-0.69; girls: OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.42-0.86)_ jam and honey (girls: OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.26-0.78) and sweets (boys: OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.48-0.98). OR of being at risk significantly increased with the highest consumption of soft drinks (younger boys) and manufactured juices (older girls). Concerning CVD risk score B_ older boys and girls in the highest tertile of consumption of breakfast cereals were 0.41 (95% CI = 0.21-0.79) and 0.45 (95% CI = 0.22-0.93) times_ respectively_ less likely to be at risk than those in tertile 1.

In pursuit of this goal_ the current study aims to predict the risk of developing first and second acute myocardial infarction_ heart failure_ non-acute ischaemic heart disease_ and stroke after diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes_ using data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register. Material and Methods Register data on 29_034 patients with type 2 diabetes were analysed over five years of follow up (baseline 2003). To develop and validate the risk equations_ the sample was randomly divided into training (75%) and test (25%) subsamples. The Weibull proportional hazard model was used to estimate the coefficients of the risk equations_ and these were validated in both the training and the test samples. Results In total_ 4_547 first and 2_418 second events were observed during the five years of follow up. Experiencing a first event substantially elevated the risk of subsequent events. There were heterogeneities in the effects of covariates within as well as between events; for example_ while for females the hazard ratio of having a first acute myocardial infarction was 0.79 (0.70–0.90)_ the hazard ratio of a second was 1.21 (0.98–1.48). The hazards of second events decreased as the time since first events elapsed. The equations showed adequate calibration and discrimination (C statistics range: 0.70–0.84 in test samples). Conclusion The accuracy of health economic simulation models of type 2 diabetes can be improved by ensuring that they account for the heterogeneous effects of covariates on the risk of first and second cardiovascular events. Thus it is important to extend such models by including risk equations for second cardiovascular events.","Towards Renewed Health Economic Simulation of Type 2 Diabetes: Risk Equations for First and Second Cardiovascular Events from Swedish Register Data"

From linear dichroism (LD) spectra of p-cresol aligned in stretched matrices of poly(vinyl alcohol) and polyethylene_ the lowest pi-pi* transition (L-b) is found to have pure polarization over its entire absorption (250-300 nm) with a transition moment perpendicular to the symmetry axis (C-1-C-4)_ both in polar and nonpolar environments. For the second transition (L-a)_ polarized parallel with the symmetry axis_ a certain admixture of intensity with orthogonal polarization is noticed_ depending on the environment.

"oai_services_scigloo_org_191372_7","The overarching question addressed in this paper is to what extent and under what circumstances the EU should be seen as an “actor” in its relations with Africa_ with a particular focus on trade_ aid and peace policies. The paper shows that whereas the EU often speaks with one voice_ for instance in trade_ it is more ambiguous and pluralistic in other policy areas_ such as aid and security/peace_ where decision-making is either “shared”_ or is based on national and intergovernmental policies. Sometimes there is even little in the way of articulated EU policy_ and the EU member states pursue their own national policies outside of the EU framework. What explains this pattern? Much like other global actors_ including the most powerful EU member states_ the EU’s actions in Africa are characterized by the pursuit of power and the manifestation of various regional and national identities and interests. The nation-state logic is still active. Going beyond the EU’s official rhetoric (which invariably contain an often misleading egalitarian flavor)_ the EU is strongly concerned with establishing itself as a global actor and with gaining political power (for various purposes). It is nevertheless clear that the EU deals with the external world — including Africa — in a different manner from that of an ordinary great power driven by geopolitical interests. This is because the civilian or ‘normative’ power employed in the EU’s own region-building is also being projected in its external relations as the preferred world order model.","The European Union as an actor in Africa: internal coherence and external legitimacy"

It is the heat exchange between the Baltic Sea surface and the atmosphere that is of interest. The databases have different origins_ comprising synoptic data_ data re-analysed with a 3D assimilation system_ an ocean model forced with gridded synoptic data_ ship data and satellite data. We compared the databases and found that the greatest variation between them is in the long- and short-wave radiation values. However_ considerable upward long-wave radiation is followed by considerable downward short-wave radiation_ so the total radiation component is partly compensated for in the total budget. The variation in the total heat transport in the databases therefore appears smaller (1.5 +/- 3 W m(-2)) as the average and one standard deviation. The turbulent heat fluxes estimated from satellite data have very low values; this can largely be explained by the method of calculating air temperature_ which also produces an unrealistic stratification over the Baltic Sea. The ERA40 data was compared with measured values: there_ we found a certain land influence even in the centre of the Baltic proper. The indicated turbulent heat fluxes were too large_ mainly in the fall and winter_ and the sensible heat flux was too large in a downward direction in spring and summer.","Evaluation of the heat balance components over the Baltic Sea using four gridded meteorological databases and direct observations"

An incompressible_ viscous fluid behaviour was assumed to clearly work out the influence of the geometrical details on flow separation and possibility and type of interaction between the free jet and solid surfaces. Very good agreement between own simulation results and experimental data from the literature shows that various viscous effects play an important part in the initial jet motion and may also be of significant influence during steady state. Especially the recirculation between free jet and the front surface of the languid of metal flue organ pipes can lead to an additional force in the jet dynamics_ the Coanda effect. It becomes important when the free jet is sufficiently close to the surface and the languid thick enough.","Numerical studies of the effect of flue exit geometry on the initial jet formation in flue organ pipes"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 56 subjects (21 girls and 35 boys_ age 7-17 years) were randomized to 3 months of active treatment (diazoxide 5-7.5 mg/kg in divided doses) or placebo in addition to multiple daily insulin injections and were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: Diazoxide decreased circulating C-peptide concentrations by approximately 50%. After cessation of the treatment_ basal and meal-stimulated C-peptide concentrations increased to a maximum at 6 months_ followed by a decline. Meal-stimulated C-peptide concentration was significantly higher at 12 months (0.43 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.26 nmol/l_ P = 0.018) and tended to fall less from clinical onset to 24 months in the diazoxide- vs. placebo-treated patients (-0.05 +/- 0.24 vs. -0.18 +/- 0.26 nmol/l_ P = 0.064). At 24 months_ the meal-stimulated C-peptide concentrations were 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.20 +/- 0.17 nmol/l_ respectively. Side effects of diazoxide were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that partial inhibition of insulin secretion for 3 months at onset of childhood type 1 diabetes suspends the period of remission and temporarily preserves residual insulin production. Further evaluation of the full potential of beta-cell rest will require compounds with less side effects as well as protocols optimized for sustained secretory arrest.","Temporary preservation of beta-cell function by diazoxide treatment in childhood type 1 diabetes"

We routinely dissected the superficial epigastric vein bilaterally and perforators ipsilaterally. If there were insufficient perforators on the ipsilateral side_ we then dissected the contralateral side. We made an additional anastomosis to the superficial epigastric vein in cases of venous congestion after reperfusion that could threaten flap survival. One perforator was used on 31 occasions_ and the contralateral side was dissected in 16. A prophylactic anastomosis of superficial epigastric vein was done in 3. No flap was lost completely but 5 partially necrosed. A comparison of the first 25 and the second 25 flaps showed more dissections of the contralateral side and more prophylactic anastomoses of the superficial epigastric vein in the second 25. Partial necrosis was less common in the second 25. We suggest that more liberal dissection of the contralateral side and the prophylactic anastomosis of the superficial epigastric vein to lower morbidity and give better cosmetic results.","Avoidance of complications after the use of deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps for reconstruction of the breast."

Requirements_ which at least are perceived as conflicting_ on one hand a low product price achieved by high volumes and economy of scale_ and on the other hand the customers´ whish of individualized products_ push for new approaches. Masscustomization has been one approach to meet the challenge. The actors´improved ability to deliver new products to the market has shortened the window in which products are competitive. This puts a pressure on the actors to improve their responsiveness. The challenges drive for further increases in efficiency and ability to customize while being profitable. One solution is reuse in its widest meaning_ e.g. parts_ concepts_ production processes and ideas_ which can be implemented with platform-based design. To deal with: concurrency in an efficient way_ derivate designs based on platforms_ and variant rich designs demands for new ways to describe the designs. The introduction of the Configurable Component Concept is intended to support concurrent_ complex_ variant rich system design in an efficient way_ in all lifecycle phases.<p/> Re-use can benefit in various ways from knowledge rich design descriptions when information_ why the design is as it is_ is explicitly given. With knowledge of the reasoning behind the design and what consideration resulted in the design_ what is referred to as the why knowledge_ it is more likely that the design can be used and re-used correctly. The why information can be perceived as a bridge_ between distances in time and space. Bridging distances in time means knowing how to use the design properly and also know how to modify it without accidently loosing wanted behavior or more fundamentally_ to dare to make any changes at all instead of re-making the complete design. Bridging distances in space deals with uses in multiple contexts_ i.e. use it in another design than the primary intended one_ as well as concurrent activities where multiple organizations are involved simultaneously.<p/> This licentiate thesis presents how the function-means tree method is integrated with the configurable component concept to act as a design rationale. This includes: an extended function-means tree method to handle design bandwidth_ a more transparent and explicit constraint handling_ and design decisions that together form an explicit function-means tree instance. The function-means tree is also adapted to work as an integrated element within a configurable component_ representing any (sub-) system design_ in contrast to the traditional representation where it represents a complete design.","Platform-Based Design - Design Rationale Aspects within the Configurable Component Concept"
"oai_sp1_slub_se_42610_7","Electrophysiological techniques are used in insect neuroscience to measure the response of olfactory neurons to volatile odour stimuli. Widely used systems to deliver an olfactory stimulus to a test insect include airstream guided flow through glass cartridges loaded with a given volatile compound on a sorbent support. Precise measurement of the quantity of compound reaching the sensory organ of the test organism is an urgent task in insect electrophysiology. In this study we evaluated the performances of the recent realised proton transfer reaction-time of flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) as a fast and selective gas sensor. In particular_ we characterised the gas emission from cartridges loaded with a set of volatile compounds belonging to different chemical classes and commonly used in electrophysiological experiments. PTR-ToF-MS allowed a fast monitoring of all investigated compounds with sufficient sensitivity and time resolution. The detection and the quantification of air contaminants and solvent or synthetic standards impurities allowed a precise quantification of the stimulus exiting the cartridge. The outcome of this study was twofold: on one hand we showed that PTR-ToF-MS allows monitoring fast processes with high sensitivity by real time detection of a broad number of compounds; on the other hand we provided a tool to solve an important issue in insect electrophysiology.","Fast Direct Injection Mass-Spectrometric Characterization of Stimuli for Insect Electrophysiology by Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight Mass-Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS)"
"oai_DiVA_org_hig2801_7","A study was conducted to investigate the influence of different approaches to arranging the pace and temporal organization of repetitive assembly and disassembly tasks on variability in performance_ and to compare assembly and disassembly times derived with psychophysical methods to more traditional Methods- Time Measurement (MTM) approaches. The conditions studied were a traditional assembly line arrangement where assemblies were started at a pace of 110 MTM_ a batch condition where subjects were required to complete 36 assemblies in the amount of time based on 110 MTM_ a line condition where subjects were required to take a break after every 6 assemblies requiring theffi to work at a 120 MTM pace_ and a psychophysical condition where subjects were allowed to choose their pace.Overall_ the results suggest that the mean times spent working remained fairly constant a cross conditions_ with more variation in pauses in between cycles. For the second self-paced condition_ subjects selected a significantly higher pace than 1 10 MTM_ which was the basis for the other conditions. The higher pace was achieved through reduction in mean pauses_ and the potential implications for musculoskeletal risk are discussed.","Influence on work pace conditions on temporal organization of work and rest"
"oai_DiVA_org_hj20984_7","<h1>Sammanfattning</h1>Sedan början av 2000-talet har det skett en markant ökning av studier gällande barn och ungdomar och Autism. Dock är det så att den mesta forskningen fortfarande är inom det medicinska området. Endast ett fåtal av studierna rör vuxna med Asperger syndrom (AS) som studerar på högskola/universitet. Samtidigt sker en ökning av personer med AS som söker högre utbildning såsom högskola/universitet_ vilket gör forskning gällande personer med diagnosen AS högaktuell. Antalet studenter med kognitiva funktionshinder_ dit AS räknas_ som sökt pedagogiskt stöd på högskola/universitet i Sverige_ har ökat från 1 427 studenter 2010 till 1 943 studenter 2012. När man studerar på högskola/universitet så finns det pedagogiska stöd att tillgå_ och till vardagen finns Lagen om stöd och service till vissa funktionshindrade (LSS) och Socialtjänstlagen (SoL) som personer med AS har möjligheter att söka stöd genom.  Personer med AS kan ibland ha svårt att utnyttja stödsystem som kräver att man själv identifierar och uttalar sina behov av stöd. Denna avhandling fokuserar på personer med AS i högre utbildning och stöd.I doktorsavhandlingen ingår två studier: Studie I som är en fallstudie och Studie II_ som är en enkätstudie. Bindningspunkten för studierna är studenter med AS som fått pedagogiskt stöd i sin utbildning vid högskola/universitet.<h2>Studie I</h2>Studie I består av en fallstudie (Merriam_ 1994_ 2009; Patton_ 2002) som innefattade tre fall. Studien redovisas i artikel I och II_ där artikel I bygger på studenternas berättelser och artikel II på anhörigas och samordnares berättelser. Insamlandet av data har byggt på berättelser genom samtal (Doecke_ Brown_ &amp; Loughran_ 2000; Hydén &amp; Brockmeier_ 2008; Johansson_ 2005; Skott_ 2004). Valet av berättelser som metod_ innebär att man som forskare fokuserar på att få möjligheter att lära känna en annan person_ få kunskap om denna persons erfarenheter_ känslor och förväntningar. För att säkerhetsställa undersökningens validitet_ användes triangulering mellan tre olika källor: intervjuer med studenter_ anhöriga och samordnare. Urvalet av högskola/universitet gjordes med avsikten att inkludera högskolor/universitet från olika delar av Sverige_ olika stora högskolor/universitet med olika studieinriktningar.Syfte med Studie I är att undersöka hur studenter med AS i högre utbildning beskriver och förstår sin livshistoria och sin studievardag_ vilket redovisas i artikel I och i kappans resultat. Anhöriga är en central resurs för personer med AS. Därför undersöks i den andra artikeln hur anhöriga uppfattar sina barns eller syskons studier och det stöd de tidigare fått i skolan och på högskola/universitet. I artikeln redovisas även hur man upplever det pedagogiska stöd som högskola/universitet erbjuder. Samordnare för studenter med funktionshinder har en central roll i vilka pedagogiska stöd som beslutas att students ska få_ därför är det också av vikt att undersöka hur samordnare beskriver den stödverksamhet som finns på högskola/universitet. Även detta redovisas i andra artikeln samt i kappans resultat.Vid insamling av data var fokus på studenternas berättelser om sin studievardag och hur de beskrev sina skolerfarenheter_ från förskola fram till högskola/universitet samt hur de såg på sin framtid (Hydén &amp; Brockmeier_ 2008). Vid samtalen med anhöriga och samordnare använde forskaren sina yrkeserfarenheter som berör AS_ diagnossättande_ mediciner_ lagar och forskning samt personliga erfarenheter. De anhöriga som intervjuades bestämdes av studenterna och bestod av en mamma_ en pappa och en syster. Samordnarna bestod av de som arbetade på den högskola/universitet som studenten studerade på.Samtalsmanual har använts som stöd vid varje samtal. Totalt har tolv samtalsmanualer använts. Samtalens längd för studenterna varierade mellan 1 timma och 4 minuter till 4 timmar och 50 minuter. Samtalens längd varierade mellan 1 timma och 10 minuter till 3 timmar och 23 minuter för de anhöriga. Samtalens längd varierade mellan 1 timma och 13 minuter till 3 timmar och 40 minuter för samordnare. Varje samtal anpassades helt efter varje anhörigs och samordnares intresse av att vilja samtala. De tre fallbeskrivningarna omfattade femton transkriberade samtal: tre vardera för varje student_ en för vardera anhörig och en för vardera samordnare. Första steget i analysen var att forskaren läste igenom det transkriberade materialet kring varje student upprepade gånger så att en känsla för helheten uppstod. Vid tredje genomläsningen gjordes noteringar i form av nyckelord som beskrev innehållet. Därefter plockades de meningar ut som innehöll information som byggde på nyckelorden och var relevanta för frågeställningarna. Den omgivande texten togs med så att sammanhanget kvarstod_ det bildade meningsbärande enheter. De meningsbärande enheterna i samtalstexterna kondenserades i syfte att korta ner texten men ändå behålla innehållet. De kodades därefter och grupperades i kategorier som återspeglade det centrala budskapet i samtalen i relation till studenterna. Samma process gjordes med de anhörigas och samordnarnas transkriberade material.I Studie I framkom det att studenter med AS ofta behöver stöd i sin studievardag_ det vill säga både i studierna och i vardagslivet_ för att klara sina studier. Personer med AS har en kognitiv funktionsnedsättning som kan ge svårigheter i deras studievardag_ och de har ofta en nedsatt förmåga att beskriva sina svårigheter och kan därför inte alltid redogöra för vilka behov de har. När man söker stöd bygger ansökan på att man själv kan beskriva sina behov av stöd och framför allt välja bland de stöd som finns utifrån det behov och de svårigheter man har_ det vill säga man ges en stor valfrihet. För studenter med AS kan detta bli till en stor svårighet då de ofta inte själva vet vilka stöd de har behov av och vad de olika stöden skulle innebära för de studiesvårigheter de har. Studenterna i studierna angav att när de fick stöd hade de svårt att förstå hur stödet skulle fungera och hur det skulle kunna förbättra deras studier_ och att det pedagogiska stödet i stället blev till ytterligare ett hinder_ som tog tid och fokus från studierna. Stödinsatsen med vidhängande valfrihet kan ses som ett uttryck för en ekvifinalitet: stödsystemet har designats för att ge olika funktionshindrade samma möjlighet_ och utgångspunkten är att valfrihet är bra för alla. Många av studenterna har beskrivit att de känner sig socialt begränsade och har kommunikationssvårigheter och de upplever att de är stigmatiserade och känner sig alienerade.I analysen av studenternas beskrivning av sin livshistoria och studievardag framstod två teman_ Kamp och Utanförskap. Anhöriga beskrev att kraven på fokusering_ både på vardags- och studentaktiviteter_ blev övermäktiga för deras barn eller syskon. De kunde se att deras barn eller syskon hade svårigheter med att planera inköp av exempelvis mat_ att laga mat_ att tvätta och sköta andra vardagsrutiner i hemmet. Samordnare för studenter med funktionshinder utryckte att även om de kunde se att studenter hade problem med vardagsrutiner i hemmet_  kunde de inte ge något stöd för detta. De hade också svårt att erbjuda stöd i vissa studietekniska frågor. Samordnarna beskrev att det är svårt att ställa frågor om en students funktionshinder_ diagnos och livssituation och att det är svårt att få grepp om vilket stöd som skulle kunna bli bra för varje enskild student.Sammantaget så har det framkommit att studenter med AS har behov av både pedagogiskt stöd och stöd i vardagsrutiner och det framkom också i studierna att de olika stöden behöver samordnas så att studenter med AS erhåller stöd i hela studievardagen. Det framkom också att det finns behov av ett kunskaps- och kommunikationsverktyg för framför allt samordnare och studenter. Detta verktyg skulle kunna användas av samordnare och student så att en tydlig agenda upprättas och följs vid samtalen och beslut om vad eller vilka pedagogiska stöd som studenten skulle kunna få som stöd i studierna.<h2>Studie II</h2>Studie II består av en enkätstudie_ bestående av 55 frågor med både öppna och slutna svarsalternativ_ riktat till studenter med AS_ studenter med rörelsehinder (RH) och studenter med hörselnedsättning (HN). Även i denna studie står studenter med AS i fokus_ men med mer generell frågeställningar: Hur beskriver studenter med AS_ RH och HN upplevda problem_ erhållet stöd och upplevt stöd? Finns det skillnader och likheter mellan dessa tre grupper av studenter? Resultatet redovisas i artikel III samt kappans resultat.Syftet med studie II är också att undersöka vilka karaktäristika för studenter med AS som kan identifieras och bedömas som så viktiga att de med stöd av Internationella klassifikation för funktionstillstånd_ funktionshinder och hälsa kan behöva ingå i ett code set. Resultatet redovisas i artikel IV samt i kappans resultat. Under arbetet med Studie I uppkom funderingar på om det fanns studentgrupper med andra funktionshinder som har samma erfarenheter som studenter med AS. Därför utökades urvalet till studenter RH och HN. Studie II var beskrivande med en mixed methods design. Den första delen hade en huvudsakligen kvantitativ ansats med data insamlade via en enkät. Till enkätstudien tillfrågades alla högskolor/universitet om de var intresserade att delta i undersökningen. Det var 14 samordnare på 12 högskolor/universitet som tackade ja till att medverka och de tillfrågade sedan de studenter som kunde vara aktuella att medverka i undersökningen. Respondenter blev 34 studenter som studerade vid 12 svenska högskolor/universitet_ 16 studenter med AS_ 11 med RH och 7 med HN. Eftersom endast 34 studenter kunde rekryteras betraktas detta som en pilotstudie. Den kan ge en första antydan om hur studievardagen upplevs av studenter med funktionshinder och om det finns någon skillnad mellan de tre undersökta grupperna av studenter när det gäller svårigheter och behov av stöd. I den andra delen av studie II togs ett första steg till ett code set_ en början till ett kommunikationsverktyg_ det vill säga en samtalsmanual mellan samordnare och studenter_ samt som information till anhöriga. Analysen hade en deduktiv_ kvalitativ ansats. Data från flera olika källor_ bland annat enkäterna_ analyserades och jämfördes genom att innehållet länkades till ICF-koder. Avsikten var att identifiera preliminärt innehåll i ett code set. Analysen av enkäterna var kvantitativ så långt materialet medgav det_ och grupperna jämfördes genom så kallad korstabulering. Nästa steg i analysen (Code set förberedelsen) fokuserade endast på studenter med AS. Information i enkäten länkades kvalitativt deduktivt till ICF tillsammans med information från fem olika källor som representerar olika perspektiv: 1) Studenters egna beskrivningar_ 2) Internationella diagnosklassifikationer_ 3) Nationella policy-dokument för högre utbildning_ 4) Hälso- och sjukvården_ 5) Brukarorganisationen Autism och Aspergerförbundet. De fem olika källorna innefattade tio dokument som valts utifrån inklusionskriterierna målgruppen AS_ åldersgruppen unga vuxna_ undervisning/utbildnings-krav för högre utbildning_ insatser/behov av stöd samt nationella/internationella källor med anknytning till målgruppen. Syftet var att integrera flera olika perspektiv på behov av stöd i studievardagen för studenter med AS. Därmed kunde en första lista med ICF-koder identifieras som underlag till ett code set för studenter med AS på högskola/universitet.I Studie II framkom det att även om studenter med AS verkade rapportera samma svårigheter_ varierade förklaringarna som gavs till problemen mellan grupperna. När det gällde förklaringar verkade det för studenter med AS vara kopplat till kognitiva svårigheter medan det för studenter med rörelsehinder (RH) och hörselnedsättning (HN) var kopplat till fysiska svårigheter. På ytan kan de olika gruppernas svårigheter alltså se lika ut och de kommer då att erbjudas samma pedagogiska stöd från sin högskola/universitet. I enkätsvaren framhölls att det var väldigt viktigt för studenterna att kunna få ett arbete efter avslutade studier för att därmed få möjligheter att kunna försörja sig och leva ett vanligt liv som alla andra. Innan dess måste dock studierna genomföras och i den studievardag som beskrevs_ talades det om kamp och utanförskap. Några av de erfarenheter som lyftes fram av alla grupperna studenter var_ stress och koncentrationssvårigheter_ trötthet_ och social begränsning .I Studie II framkom alltså samma problem som i Studie I med att tydligt uttrycka svårigheter och behov. Det indikerar att det finns behov av ett kunskaps- och kommunikationsverktyg för samtal mellan samordnare och studenter. Ett ICF baserat code set för högre utbildning för studenter med AS skulle kunna vara ett sådant verktyg. Ett code set består av ett antal kategorier från ICF och beskriver de svårigheter som studenter med AS kan ha och som kan bilda en checklista att arbeta utifrån vid samtal_ planering av stöd och information till annan personal. Det ska vara så tydligt att det kan ges till studenten i förväg så att studenten får möjligheter att förbereda sig på vad samtalet och mötet innebär.Avslutningsvis har det framkommit att om studenter med AS ska bli inkluderade i högre utbildning och om uteslutningsmekanismer såsom stigmatisering och alienation ska motverkas_ krävs det troligen tydligt strukturerade individuella lösningar: Stödet ska ge en öppning mot en multifinalitet istället för den ekvifinalitet som idag råder vid erbjudande av stöd. Lösningar och stöd ska inte bara vara baserade på en diagnos_ utan på en analys av varje students upplevda svårigheter sett ur perspektivet hela studievardagen. Först då kan stöden bli till de verkligt frigörande möjligheter som är avsikten. ","”Man vill ju klara sig själv”"
"oai_DiVA_org_hj20984_7","<h1>Summary</h1>Since the beginning of the 21st century there has been a significantly increased number of studies on children and young adults with Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD). Most of this research falls within the domain of Medicine and only limited number of studies focusses on adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) as students at university. Considering that there is an increase in numbers of individuals diagnosed with AS attending tertiary education researching this group of individuals is both timely and opportune.The number of students with cognitive disabilities_ such as AS_ seeking assistance to help their study efforts along at universities has increased in Sweden from 1427 students in 2010 to 1943 students in 2012. It should be noted that support in everyday student-life is guaranteed by legislation (that is_ by Social Service Act (SoL) and  Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments (LSS)) and that this same guarantee is valid also of studying at university. However_ individuals with AS may at times have difficulty using available support_ since they must identify their own needs and also communicate the nature of their need. This doctoral thesis is focusing on individuals with AS in need of such support in tertiary education.The thesis is comprised by two main studies: Study I_ which is a case study_ and Study II_ which is a survey. Their common denominator is students with AS who have received legally guaranteed support as university students.<h2>study I</h2>The first study is a case study of three cases. This research is reported in the two first articles of the four articles comprising the entire thesis. The first article focusses on student narratives_ whereas article two rather focusses on the accounts of next of kin as well as those of university coordinators I charge of assisting students in need. Data were collected through conversations. The particular choice of method allows for the researcher to acquire more intimate knowledge of the participants learning of their experiences_ feelings and expectations. To secure validity the data from students_ next of kin and university coordinators was triangulated. Number and type of universities included in the study were sampled on the principle that there should be included universities from different parts of Sweden_ of different sizes and with different academic profiles.The aim of Study I was to investigate how students with AS_ as students in tertiary education_ describe their life history and their everyday student-life. This particular focus is reported in the first article. Next of kin are central to individuals with AS. In the second article therefore_ the perceptions of next of kind and how these understand their children’s or sibling’s university studies as well as the available support for them are accounted for. Also university coordinators in charge of study assistance at universities are of considerable importance. They decide the manner of support provided. It is therefore important to also describe how these outline and assess the existing support. This too is the focus of the second article.During data collection the focus was on students’ narratives of their everyday student-life at university as well as how they experienced their entire education experience from pre-school and to tertiary education. The views of their own future was also an issue that was addressed. The conversations with participants were facilitated by the researcher in terms of conveying previous research results on the nature of AS individuals’ experience of university education; of the researcher’s professional experiences of the situation and also of herself being next of kin to an individual with an AS diagnosis. As a means of helping conversations with next of kin and coordinators along the researcher used her own professional experience in relation to AS individuals_ diagnosing_ medication_ legal framework_ previous research and personal experience. Which next of kin to be interviewed - a mother_ father and a sibling - was decided by the participating students themselves. For each university there is generally only one coordinator. These participated in the study.A conversation manual has been used as support for each data collecting conversation. In all_ twelve such manuals have been used. The length of the conversations with participating students varied between 1 hour and 4 minutes to 4 hours and 50 minutes. Conversations with next of kind varied between 1 hour and 10 minutes to 3 hours and 23 minutes and for coordinators the duration varied between 1 hour and 10 minutes to 3 hours and 40 minutes. Every conversation was entirely adapted to each participating individual and their willingness to converse about the subject matter.The three cases were comprised of 15 transcribed conversations: three for each student_ one for each next of kin_ and also one for each university coordinator. As a first step in analysing the data the researcher read transcriptions multiple times to lay foundations for an understanding of entirety. During the third read notes were taken in the form of key words significant to content. Extraction of sentences containing these keywords followed. Key words were always significant in relation to the research questions. The surrounding text was taken too in order to preserve context. Together the keywords_ the sentences and the surrounding contexts constituted meaningful units of text. These units_ in every transcribed conversation_ were condensed in order to shorten texts but still maintain the essence of its meaningful content. The condensed text units were coded and grouped in categories that reflected the essential and meaningful content of the conversations. Data culled from the next of kin and the coordinators were submitted to the same process of data analysis.Results showed that students with AS often do need assistance at university both in terms of studying as well as in their daily life off campus in order to manage an existence as students. Individuals with AS however have a cognitive disability that may challenge their efforts as students. In addition_ they have difficulties describing their problems and often find it hard to define which needs for assistance they do have. When applying for assistance students are required to specify their special needs of support_ and more importantly_ also choose what kind of assistance they require. In other words_ they are given a considerable freedom of choice. To students with AS this presents an obstacle. They often do not know what kind of assistance they require and what a certain kind of support would entail. Participating students reported that it was difficult for them to grasp how the support would actually function and how it would improve their studying. Instead_ the possibility of acquiring support became yet another problem which made studying even more difficult for them. The availability of support with the accompanying freedom of choice as to the manner and content of the support may be seen as an expression of equifinality. That is_ the support system has been designed to provide each disabled individual with equal opportunity of attaining support. The basic value underpinning the support system is that freedom of choice is valuable to each and every one. However_ many students with AS have reported that they feel socially limited_ alienated even stigmatised and that they communicate poorly.In analysing the narratives of students’ life histories as well as their everyday student-life as students two themes emerged: Struggle and Alienation. The next of kin described the demands of focus_ both on and off campus_ to be overwhelming for their children or siblings. They observed difficulties with planning ahead to shop for groceries_ to do laundry_ to cook or to do sundry domestic chores at home. University coordinators understood that students had such problems off campus but could not offer assistance relating to off-campus difficulties. However_ they also found it difficult to offer these students assistance pertaining to certain aspects of student life. They found it tricky to pose questions regarding students’ disability_ diagnosis and general life situation. It was thus a problem for them to acquire an understanding of what kind of assistance that would be suitable for each individual student.In all_ the research clearly showed that students with AS are in need of both educational support and everyday student-life support and that these two aspects of assistance need to be coordinated. Results also suggested the need of a tool for knowledge and communication_ especially for students and university coordinators. Such a tool would facilitate the communication and would serve as a basis in deciding what kind of remedial action that needs to be taken for the benefit of students with AS.<h2>Study II</h2>The second study was operationalized as a survey study employing a questionnaire consisting of 55 questions of which some were open-ended. This instrument was administered to students with Asperger Syndrome (AS)_ to students with mobility impairment (MD) and to students with impaired hearing (HD). Note that abbreviations relate to the Swedish nomenclature for these disabilities.This study also focussed on students with AS but addressed more general questions: How do students with AS_ MD and HD describe problems_ provided support and the experience of being given support? Are there similarities or differences between these three groups of students? This research is presented in the third article of the doctoral thesis.The aim of the second study was also to explore what characteristics of students with AS could be identified as particularly important in an effort to classify them as a code set with the framework of the International Classification of Functioning_ Disability and Health (ICF). A code set consists of a number of categories derived from the ICF classification system. It describes the type and nature of difficulties that for example students with AS may experience_ thus constituting a checklist from which to work when university coordinators and students discuss the nature and manner of support needed and then succinctly be able to convey such information to other relevant staff. Such a tool will need to be straight-forward and given to students prior to meeting the coordinators in order to help students prepare for the meeting being fully informed of its content and purpose. The result of this exploratory second study is presented in the fourth article. As the study of AS student cases progressed there arose questions regarding other students with different kinds of disability also. Do they have the same or similar problems? For this reason a second study was launched and mobility impaired students (MD) and hearing impaired students (HD) were included also. This study was descriptive but operationalized as a mixed methods design. The first part of it consisted of a quantitatively based questionnaire. All Swedish universities and higher education institutions were invited to take part. Fourteen coordinators from 12 universities accepted. They in turn asked students to take part. In all_ 34 students decided to participate. These were divided into the following categories: 16 (AS)_ 11 (MD) and 7 (HD). Due to the relatively low number of participants the study is best considered to be a pilot study. It could be suggestive in reference to how everyday student-life on campus might be experienced by students with different disabilities and whether there are differences between the three studied groups in need of support.In the second part of the second study a first step was taken towards creating a code set; the beginning of a communication tool serving as a conversation manual between coordinator and students. The analysis of the data was qualitative but deductive. Data from several sources_ including the questionnaire_ were analysed_ compared and linked to ICF-codes in order to identify a tentative content of a potential code set.The data culled by the questionnaires was first cross-tabulated. The next phase of the analysis was the code set preparation_ focussing only on students with AS. Analysed data were linked qualitatively and deductively to ICF together with information from five different sources: 1) Student narratives_ 2) International diagnosis classifications_ 3) National policy-documents of higher education_ 4) National healthcare and 5) The Swedish Autism and Asperger Syndrome Association. In all_ 10 documents were included on the basis of  the AS target group_ age group young adults_ education and education guidelines for higher education_ remedial work_ need of support as well as national and international sources relating to the target group. The aim was to integrate several perspectives of needs of support in reference to AS students and their everyday student-life on a university campus.Results of the second study showed that even though other groups also reported problems similar to those of the AS students their explanations varied. While the problems of AS students appeared linked to cognitive difficulties_ the problems of mobility impaired students (MD) and hearing impaired students (HD) were linked to physical difficulties. The difficulties and each group would appear similar at first sight which in practical terms means that they also would be offered the same kind of support as students at universityThe analysis of the questionnaire suggested the importance of students acquiring a job after graduation_ to be able to earn a living and lead a normal everyday student-life like most others. However_ prior to such a possible future studies must be completed and participants’ experiences of being university students appeared not the best. They spoke of struggle and alienation. Some of the experiences common to all three groups were stress and concentration difficulties_ fatigue and social limitations.Hence_ the second study_ just like the first study_ clearly showed both problems and needs_ which suggested the necessity of a knowledge and communication tool for coordinators and students. An ICF-based code set for students with AS in higher education could serve as such a tool.In conclusion_ results also suggested that if students with AS are to be included in higher education_ and exclusion mechanisms such as stigmatisation and alienation be overcome_ then clearly structured solutions - individual to each student - are also needed. Offered support must conform to multifinality rather than to equifinality as is currently the case in Sweden. Individual support cannot be based entirely on a diagnosis but also on an analysis of each student’s experienced difficulties in their immediate university environment of studying. Then_ possibly_ the available and legally guaranteed support would become as empowering as it was intended to actually be. ","”Man vill ju klara sig själv”"
"oai_DiVA_org_hj5679_7","The aim of this study was to describe nurses' conceptions of decision making with regard to life-sustaining treatment for dialysis patients. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 nurses caring for such patients at three hospitals. The interview material was subjected to qualitative content analysis. The nurses saw decision making as being characterized by uncertainty and by lack of communication and collaboration among all concerned. They described different ways of handling decision making_ as well as insufficiency of physician-nurse collaboration_ lack of confidence in physicians_ hindrances to patient participation_ and ambivalence about the role of patients' next of kin. Future research should test models for facilitating communication and decision making so that decisions will emerge from collaboration of all concerned.

Spin-stabilized collection probes are ejected from a sounding rocket allowing for multi-point measurements. Each probe is equipped with 110 collection samples that are 3 mm in diameter. The collection samples are one of three types: standard transmission electron microscopy carbon grids_ glass fibre filter paper or silicone gel. Collection samples are exposed over a 50 m to 5 km height range with a total of 45 separate ranges. Post-flight electron microscopy will give size-resolved information on particle number_ shape and elemental composition. Each collection probe is equipped with a suite of sensors to capture the probe's status during the fall. Parachute recovery systems along with GPS-based localization will ensure that each probe can be located and recovered for post-flight analysis.","Technical Note"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth136178_7","The radiative mechanism responsible for the prompt gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission remains elusive. For the last decade_ optically thin synchrotron emission from shocks internal to the GRB jet appeared to be the most plausible explanation. However_ the synchrotron interpretation is incompatible with a significant fraction of GRB observations_ highlighting the need for new ideas. In this thesis_ it is shown that the narrow_ dominating component of the prompt emission from the bright GRB090902B is initially consistent only with emission released at the optically thick jet photosphere. However_ this emission component then broadens in time into a more typical GRB spectrum_ which calls for an explanation. In this thesis_ a previously unconsidered way of broadening the spectrum of photospheric emission_ based on considerations of the lateral jet structure_ is presented and explored. Expressions for the spectral features_ as well as polarization properties_ of the photospheric emission observed from structured_ relativistic jets are derived analytically under simplifying assumptions on the radiative transfer close to the photosphere. The full_ polarized radiative transfer is solved through Monte Carlo simulations_ using a code which has been constructed for this unique purpose. It is shown that the typical observed GRB spectrum can be obtained from the photosphere_ without the need for additional_ commonly assumed_ physical processes (e.g. energy dissipation_ particle acceleration_ or additional radiative processes). Furthermore_ contrary to common expectations_ it is found that the observed photospheric emission can be highly linearly polarized (up to $\sim 40 \_ \%$). In particular_ it is shown that a shift of $\pi/2$ of the angle of polarization is the only shift allowed by the proposed model_ consistent with the only measurement preformed to date. A number of ways to test the theory is proposed_ mainly involving simultaneous spectral and polarization measurements. The simplest measurement_ which tests not only the proposed theory but also common assumptions on the jet structure_ involves only two consecutive measurements of the angle of polarization during the prompt emission.","Photospheric emission from structured_ relativistic jets"

We demonstrate that the electromagnetic (spectral) degree of coherence put forward in Opt. Lett. 29_ 328 (2004) [or its space-time analog in Opt. Express 11_ 1137 (2003)] is physically related to the contrasts of modulation in the four Stokes parameters. More explicitly_ the electromagnetic degree of coherence is a measure of both the visibility of the intensity fringes and the modulation contrasts of the three polarization Stokes parameters. We also show that by using suitable wave plates the modulation in any Stokes parameter can be transformed into the form of intensity variation_ and hence the electromagnetic degree of coherence can be obtained experimentally by four visibility measurements.","Contrasts of Stokes parameters in Young's interference experiment and electromagnetic degree of coherence"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth17703_7","This work proposes and analyzes an anisotropic sparse grid stochastic collocation method for solving partial differential equations with random coefficients and forcing terms ( input data of the model). The method consists of a Galerkin approximation in the space variables and a collocation_ in probability space_ on sparse tensor product grids utilizing either Clenshaw-Curtis or Gaussian knots. Even in the presence of nonlinearities_ the collocation approach leads to the solution of uncoupled deterministic problems_ just as in the Monte Carlo method. This work includes a priori and a posteriori procedures to adapt the anisotropy of the sparse grids to each given problem. These procedures seem to be very effective for the problems under study. The proposed method combines the advantages of isotropic sparse collocation with those of anisotropic full tensor product collocation: the first approach is effective for problems depending on random variables which weigh approximately equally in the solution_ while the benefits of the latter approach become apparent when solving highly anisotropic problems depending on a relatively small number of random variables_ as in the case where input random variables are Karhunen-Loeve truncations of "smooth" random fields. This work also provides a rigorous convergence analysis of the fully discrete problem and demonstrates ( sub) exponential convergence in the asymptotic regime and algebraic convergence in the preasymptotic regime_ with respect to the total number of collocation points. It also shows that the anisotropic approximation breaks the curse of dimensionality for a wide set of problems. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results and are used to compare this approach with several others_ including the standard Monte Carlo. In particular_ for moderately large-dimensional problems_ the sparse grid approach with a properly chosen anisotropy seems to be very efficient and superior to all examined methods.","An anisotropic sparse grid stochastic collocation method for partial differential equations with random input data"

These phenomena complicate both their design and performance analysis. We consider a WLAN with CSMA/CA MAC protocol over mobile radio channels and evaluate its performance in terms of average throughput and average packet delay. In order to improve the system performance_ we propose the use of different packet combining methods where the receiver keeps wrongly detected packets_ combines them with their retransmitted versions and then makes a decision. Such a simple technique is well suited for wireless LANs since it provides a diversity gain to the system that can reduce interference problem (hidden terminal situation) and improve the capture effect. Simulation results show that both maximum ratio packet combining (MRPC) and hard decision can achieve a considerable gain in system throughput","Performance enhancement of wireless LANs through packet combining"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth21816_7","The influence of hydrogen in Fe_ 301 stainless steel (SS 301)_ and Avesta 353MA on corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions was studied. The oxidation kinetics of uncoated and Pt-coated Fe was also investigated in O-2 at 500 and 700degreesC. Electrochemical and weight loss measurements were used to evaluate the corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions_ and the high-temperature oxidation rate was determined by measuring the pressure decrease in a closed volume. Observations of a high dissolution rate of Fe and SS 301 in deionized water_ as well as a high oxidation rate in O-2_ can be explained by an increased metal cation transport in the oxide film induced by hydrogen in the metal. However_ hydrogen up to a certain concentration in Avesta 353MA was found to increase the resistance to localized corrosion in chloride solution. Pt coating on Fe was found to decrease the oxidation rate and improve scale adherence. The presented results are discussed in view of recent findings of balanced metal cation and oxygen anion transport in protective metal oxides.","Influence of hydrogen in iron and in two stainless steels on aqueous and gaseous corrosion"

This methodology enables the designer to further raise the abstraction level of the initial system specification and to achieve optimized embedded system designs. This methodology is well suited for systems characterized by a set of concurrent and dynamic processes_ very high-bit-rate data streams_ and intensive data transfer and storage_ as encountered in telecom network applications. Up to now_ it has been successfully applied to four telecom network systems. This methodology can be easily integrated into any C++-based system synthesis approach that bridges the gap between a concurrent process-level system specification and an optimized (for area_ performance_ or power) embedded implementation of communicating hardware/software processors. This is in contrast to current system design practice_ where VHDL/C is derived without room for exploration_ refinement_ and verification_ leading to expensive late design iterations. In this paper_ the main focus lies on the system-level specification model and the dynamic memory management applied to two real-life telecom network systems.","Dynamic memory management methodology applied to embedded telecom network systems"

In most work about perfect codes_ two codes are considered equivalent if there is an isometric mapping between them. We call this isometric equivalence. Another type of equivalence is given if two codes can be mapped on each other using a non-singular linear map. We call this linear equivalence. A third type of equivalence is given if two codes can be mapped on each other using a composition of an isometric map and a non-singular linear map. We call this extended equivalence.In Paper 1 we give a new better bound on how much the cost of the matching problem with exponential edge costs varies from its mean.In Paper 2 we calculate the expected cost of an LP-relaxed version of the matching problem where some edges are given zero cost. A special case is when the vertices with probability 1 – p have a zero cost loop_ for this problem we prove that the expected cost is given by a formula.In Paper 3 we define the polymatroid assignment problem and give a formula for calculating all moments of its cost.In Paper 4 we present a computer enumeration of the 197 isometric equivalence classes of the perfect codes of length 31 of rank 27 and with a kernel of dimension 24.In Paper 5 we investigate when it is possible to map two perfect codes on each other using a non-singular linear map.In Paper 6 we give an invariant for the equivalence classes of all perfect codes of all lengths when linear equivalence is considered.In Paper 7 we give an invariant for the equivalence classes of all perfect codes of all lengths when extended equivalence is considered.In Paper 8 we define a class of perfect codes that we call FRH-codes.

"oai_DiVA_org_liu81656_7","Oxidative stress induces apoptosis_ or necrosis_ initiated by iron-catalyzed_ intra-lysosomal oxidation leading to lysosomal rupture. Moderate lysosomal disruption induces apoptosis_ while more extensive release of lysosomal contents results in necrosis. Enhanced cellular production of reactive oxygen (presumably of mitochondrial origin) also occurs during apoptosis caused by a variety of proapoptotic agonists_ raising the question of whether increased oxidant generation is causal or consequential. In mixtures of rat liver lysosomes and mitochondria_ selective rupture of the lysosomes by the lysosornotropic detergent 0-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride (MSDH) triggers augmented mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and release of cytochrome c. These mitochondrial effects are also caused by addition of purified cathepsins B and D_ as well as phospholipase A2 (PLA2). We have earlier shown that PLA2 is activated by lysosomal rupture in cells undergoing apoptosis_ and we now find that PLA2 - but not cathepsins B or D - causes destabilization of the membranes of semi-purified lysosomes_ suggesting an amplification mechanism. In intact cultured fibroblasts_ added MSDH induces lysosomal rupture_ intracellular oxidant production_ and apoptosis. These results suggest that initiation of the apoptotic cascade by agonists other than exogenous oxidants may involve early release of lysosomal constituents (such as cathepsins Band D) and activation of PLA2. These agents may act in concert to promote mitochondrial oxidant production_ further lysosomal rupture and_ finally_ mitochondrial cytochrome c release.

"oai_DiVA_org_oru27541_7","The purpose of this dissertation is critically to illustrate discursive recontextualization between sociocultural production and reproduction_ with respect to both relations within and relations to music education in Swedish upper-secondary school.The starting point for the study is the Swedish upper-secondary school reform_ Gy 2011_ which has involved a marked reformulation of the agenda for music education in upper-secondary school. The general Artistic Activities disappeared_ at the same time as the significance of a specialising education in the field was strengthened. This dissertation is driven by the desire to understand the results of the upper-secondary school reform by explaining the processes and principles involved. But_ in a wider perspective_ the dissertation deals not only with a single reform_ but encompasses a search for the underlying principles that have had_ and are having_ a regulating effect on the design and positioning of music in publicly regulated education.The results show that structuring of the subject of music takes place primarily through the classification and framing of social relationships in general_ and of interactional relationships in particular. The focus of these relationships has shifted from time to time_ and varies from context to context_ but has always been in relation to something that has been regarded as sacred. In recent times_ the framing within music-oriented knowledge practices has become weaker. At the same time_ such knowledge practices have shown an increasing need for the drawing of boundaries in relation to other knowledge practices. The latter also has a value in explaining why general music content was removed from the upper-secondary school curriculum_ whereas a special and specialising educational programme was able to gain legitimacy.","Musik i (ut)bildning"

The mutagenicity of the two PAH-diol epoxides (+)-anti-7_8-dihydroxy-9_10-epoxy-7_8_9_10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) and (±)-anti-11_12-dihydroxy-13_14-epoxy-11_12_13_14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a_l]pyrene (DBPDE) was compared in nucleotide excision repair (NER) proficient and deficient hamster cell lines. We applied the 32P-postlabelling assay to analyze adduct levels and the hprt gene mutation assay for monitoring mutations. It was found that the mutagenicity per target dose was 4 times higher for DBPDE compared to BPDE in NER proficient cells while in NER deficient cells_ the mutagenicity per target dose was 1.4 times higher for BPDE. In order to investigate to what extent the mutagenicity of the different adducts in NER proficient cells was influenced by repair or replication bypass_ we measured the overall NER incision rate_ the rate of adduct removal_ the rate of replication bypass and the frequency of induced recombination in the hprt gene. The results suggest that NER of BPDE lesions are 5 times more efficient than for DBPDE lesions_ in NER proficient cells. However_ DBPDE adducts block replication more efficiently and also induce 6 times more recombination events in the hprt gene than adducts of BPDE_ suggesting that DBPDE adducts are_ to a larger extent_ bypassed by homologous recombination. The results obtained here indicate that the mutagenicity of PAH is influenced not only by NER_ but also by replication bypass fidelity. This has been postulated earlier based on results using in vitro enzyme assays_ but is now also being recognized in terms of forward mutations in intact mammalian cells.","Both replication bypass fidelity and repair efficiency influence the yield of mutations per target dose in intact mammalian cells induced by benzo(a)pyrene-diol-epoxide and dibenzo(a_l)-pyrene-diol-epoxide."

The survey region is a stripe 2.5° wide centered on the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap that has been imaged numerous times in earlier years_ enabling construction of a deep reference image for the discovery of new objects. Supernova imaging observations are being acquired between September 1 and November 30 of 2005-7. During the first two seasons_ each region was imaged on average every five nights. Spectroscopic follow-up observations to determine supernova type and redshift are carried out on a large number of telescopes. In its first two three-month seasons_ the survey has discovered and measured light curves for 327 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia_ 30 probable SNe Ia_ 14 confirmed SNe Ib/c_ 32 confirmed SNe II_ plus a large number of photometrically identified SNe Ia_ 94 of which have host-galaxy spectra taken so far.

"oai_DiVA_org_su35607_7","Indigenous medicine is important to rural livelihoods_ but lay knowledge and use ofmedicinal plants has not been extensively studied. Research in KwaZulu-Natal_ South Africa_ showed that medicinal plants were frequently used by villagers and contributed to their ability to cope with health problems. Knowledge of plants and household remedies was extensive and varied in that households often held different knowledge. Villagers mainly relied on common species_ and were generally aware of alternative species for a certain ailment. People were flexible in their use of indigenous and western health care_ which were both perceived as beneficial. Improved cooperation between health care systems could improve health standards. Extraction of medicinal plants has been described as unsustainable in the region found in the study area. It is argued that conservation policies aimed to restrict access should be differential and potentially not include local consumption_ since this may be ecologically unnecessary and entail local hardships.","Indigenous medicine and primary health care: The importance of lay knowledge and use of medicinal plants in rural South Africa"
"oai_DiVA_org_su42240_7","We examine the potential importance of consumer ambiguity aversion for asset prices and how consumption fluctuations influence consumer welfare. First_ considering a simple Mehra-Prescott-style endowment economy with a representative agent facing consumption fluctuations calibrated to match U.S. data_ we study to what extent ambiguity aversion can deliver asset prices that are consistent with data: a high return on equity and a low return on riskfree bonds. For some configurations of preference parameters – a discount factor_ a degree of relative risk aversion_ and a measure of ambiguity aversion – we find that it can. Then_ we use these parameter configurations to investigate how much consumers would be willing to pay to reduce endowment fluctuations to zero_ thus delivering a Lucas-style welfare cost of fluctuations. These costs turn out to be very large: consumers are willing to pay over 10% of consumption in permanent terms.","Ambiguity Aversion_ the Equity Premium_ and the Welfare Costs of Business Cycles"
"oai_DiVA_org_su495_7","The life-history of an organism can be studied and understood in terms of acquisition and expenditure of resources. In butterflies_ the use of resources for reproduction has been the focus of much research due to the possibility to easily quantify both the input of resources from different sources over the life-cycle as well as the partitioning of these resources to reproduction. In the first part of my thesis we studied how the pattern of partitioning of resources between somatic tissue_ such as muscles_ wings and exoskeleton_ and storage of resources for reproductive purposes during metamorphosis affects reproduction. Theory predicts that reproduction should be strongly dependent on the relative investments in soma and reproductive reserves_ but this has generally proven difficult to show empirically. Butterflies are eminently suited for testing this prediction_ and our results show that fecundity of female comma butterflies (Polygonia c-album) is strongly influenced by allocation priorities. One aspect of resource use that has not attracted attention until recently is the possibility that butterflies during the reproductive stage can break down flight muscles in the thorax and use muscle nutrients for reproduction. Since butterflies are generally resource limited this could alleviate the costs resulting from somatic investment found in paper I. Through a series of studies we show that thorax mass and nitrogen content decreases over the adult lifespan in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that thorax resources are used for reproduction. In order to determine if these resources could actually come from the flight muscles_ something that is known to occur in other insects_ the reduction in flight muscle size over the lifespan was studied in the green-veined white butterfly (Pieris napi). The results showed that flight muscle size decreased with on average 75% in long-lived females_ suggesting that breakdown of flight muscles could indeed influence reproduction. Taken together_ the work in this thesis shows that resource allocation during metamorphosis strongly influences the reproductive potential_ but that butterflies can overcome some of the costs of somatic investment by reallocating resources from thoracic tissue to reproduction.","Allocation of body resources to reproduction in butterflies"

"oai_DiVA_org_umu1934_7","The present thesis aims to study the relationship between the violence that occurs in institutional care for older people and the language employed when this violence and the involved parties are talked and narrated. The thesis has been guided by social constructionism_ and violence_ victims and perpetrators have been considered as social phenomena constructed in discursive processes.Narrative interviews were conducted with 57 care providers who had been involved in social interactions in which violence occurred. The thesis comprises four studies. Study I is a qualitative description of the interactions. In study II_ narrative analysis and positioning theory were used to explore the involved parties’ positions. Discourse analysis was employed to investigate discursively created identities (Study III)_ discursive constructions and how problems related to violence are framed (Study IV).When the care providers described the interactions_ they talked about mutual misunderstandings_ mutual invasions of personal space and an acceptance of violence in their work. It seemed more reasonable to consider the involved parties as both victims and perpetrators as opposed to one party being exposed and the other perpetrating the violence (I). When the positions of victim and perpetrator were questioned in one care provider’s narrative_ they appeared to alter from perpetrator to victim to protector throughout the account by use of available discourses. The way of narrating_ taking up or resisting the positions offered by the available discourses made it possible to create a preferred identity (II). These discursively created identities can be viewed as a way of defining an undesirable situation_ thereby legitimizing the actions taken. The various identities led to consequences and effects such as loss of autonomy_ the use of force_ humiliation and exclusion. The construction of identities was connected to various beliefs about older persons (III). Beliefs define what actions are possible and legitimate in a certain context as well as forming the basis for the articulation of problems_ thus studying such expressions made it possible to explore beliefs. The articulated problems were viewed as a way to create boundaries_ indicating certain possible and relevant solutions. When the care providers talked about the interactions_ they presented them as being due to a difficult and unavoidable problem related to the illness_ caring for the body_ competence and profession as well as social order (IV).The discursive struggle_ competence_ power_ powerlessness_ resistance_ identity constructions_ justification and quality of care are reflected upon and discussed. The analysis of the care providers’ narratives has made it possible to disclose how discourses concur and compete in order to give meaning to concrete social interactions involving violence. It has also been possible to show how to describe_ understand and resist as well as to legitimize and justify the actions performed in relation to such interactions. The narratives opened up possibilities to study practices that are talked about as natural. The things that the care providers narrated about have been regarded as manifestations of discourses. Discourses produce certain versions of the interactions_ victims and perpetrators_ but it must be borne in mind that these are just a few among many possible versions_ which are constantly changing.","Våld i särskilda boenden för äldre"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu31624_7","Haemolysin from enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC-Hly)_ a putative EHEC virulence factor_ belongs to the RTX (repeat-in-toxin) family whose members rapidly inactivate themselves by self-aggregation. By investigating the status of EHEC-Hly secreted extracellularly_ we found the toxin both in a free_ soluble form and associated_ with high tendency and independently of its acylation status_ to outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) extruded by EHEC. We compared the interaction of both toxin forms with erythrocytes using scanning electron microscopy and binding assays. The OMV-associated toxin was substantially (80 times) more stable under physiological conditions than the free EHEC-Hly as demonstrated by prolonged haemolytic activity (half-life time 20 h versus 15 min). The haemolysis was preceded by calcium-dependent binding of OMVs carrying EHEC-Hly to erythrocytes; this binding was mediated by EHEC-Hly. We demonstrate that EHEC-Hly is a biologically active cargo in OMVs with dual roles: a cell-binding protein and a haemolysin. These paired functions produce a biologically potent form of the OMV-associated RTX toxin and augment its potential towards target cells. Our findings provide a general concept for stabilization of RTX toxins and open new insights into the biology of these important virulence factors.","Vesicular stabilization and activity augmentation of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli haemolysin."
"oai_DiVA_org_uu104880_7","Parents face a timing problem as to when they should begin devoting resources from their own growth and survival to mating and offspring development. Seed mass and number_ as well as maternal survival via plant size_ are dependent on time for development. The time available in the favorable season will also affect the size of the developing juveniles and their survival through the unfavorable season. Flowering time may thus represent the outcome of such a time partitioning problem. We analyzed correlations between flowering onset time_ seed mass_ and plant height in a north-temperate flora_ using both cross-species comparisons and phylogenetic comparative methods. Among perennial herbs_ flowering onset time was negatively correlated with seed mass (i.e. plants with larger seeds started flowering earlier) while flowering onset time was positively correlated with plant height. Neither of these correlations was found among woody plants. Among annual plants_ flowering onset time was positively correlated with seed mass. Cross-species and phylogenetically informed analyses largely agreed_ except that flowering onset time was also positively correlated with plant height among annuals in the cross-species analysis. The different signs of the correlations between flowering onset time and seed mass (compar. gee regression coefficient=−7.8) and flowering onset time and plant height (compar. gee regression coefficient=+30.5) for perennial herbs_ indicate that the duration of the growth season may underlie a tradeoff between maternal size and offspring size in perennial herbs_ and we discuss how the partitioning of the season between parents and offspring may explain the association between early flowering and larger seed mass among these plants.","Time – size tradeoffs: a phylogenetic comparative study of flowering time_ plant height and seed mass in a north-temperate flora"

Patients and methods: In a cohort of 23 796 consecutive autopsies_ performed using a standardized procedure and representing 84% of all in-hospital deaths between 1970 and 1982 in an urban Swedish population_ we investigated the relationship between verified arterial thrombosis and VTE_ with the hypothesis that patients with thrombosis in major artery segments have increased odds of VTE. Results: We found an increased risk of VTE in patients with arterial thrombosis (Odds ratio; OR adjusted for gender and age 1.4_ 95% confidence interval; CI 1.3-1.5) (P &lt; 0.001). Patients with cervico-cranial and peripheral artery thrombosis had an excess risk even when controlling for age and major concomitant diseases. A negative association between coronary thrombosis and VTE in the univariate analysis (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6-0.8) (P &lt; 0.001)_ was less pronounced in the multivariate analysis (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-1.0) (P = 0.016). Conclusions: A positive association between atherothrombosis and VTE was confirmed_ except in patients with coronary thrombosis_ where IHD as competing death cause is a possible confounder.

The structural data derived is used to understand the parameters that govern the formation of cavity-windows and to propose synthetic strategies in order to control independently the size of the cavities and cavity-windows. Results support that whilst attainment of Pm3n cubic packing is due to the overall surfactant geometry_ the formation of cavity-windows is associated with the hydration layer formed at the interphase between the surfactant and the silica wall.  The charge density at the micelle surface may be tailored using two strategies: (i) using dicationic gemini surfactants at low pHs resulting in an increase in the hydration layer; or (ii) by using co-structure directing agents such as organoalkoxysilanes which reduce the hydration layer surrounding the micelles. The latter leads to the formation of higher cavity sizes and may be useful for tuning fine structural details of mesoporous materials when considering their use in important applications such as gas separation.","Structural variations in mesoporous materials with cubic Pm3n symmetry"

Methods: All participants were screened in a live_ structured interview before inclusion. The study period was 12 weeks and the treatment consisted of education_ cognitive skills acquisition_ behavioural rehearsal_ generalization and maintenance. The main outcome of interest was the catastrophizing subscale of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire. Results: There were statistically significant reductions from pre- to post-treatment in catastrophizing in the treatment group_ and an improvement in quality of life for the treatment group. However_ most outcome measures did not indicate a positive treatment outcome. On a scale measuring pain catastrophizing_ 58% (15/26) of the treated participants showed reliable improvement_ compared with 18% (5/28) of the control group.

Initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (RDAs) and MIC assays with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2_ Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as test strains. For the most active peptide_ cyO2_ time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species. Charged residues in cyO2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays.RESULTS:CyO2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and E. coli in RDAs and MIC assays_ while the other peptides were less active. In time-kill assays_ cyO2 also had bactericidal activity against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast_ none of the cyclotides had high activity against S. aureus. Chemical masking of the charged Glu and Lys residues in cyO2 caused a near total loss of activity against Salmonella_ while masking Arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction.CONCLUSIONS:CyO2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The charged residues in cyO2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. In combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides_ cyO2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.","The cyclotide cycloviolacin O2 from Viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu159464_7","Rationale: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are heterogeneous with respect to inflammation and etiology. Objectives: Investigate biomarker expression in COPD exacerbations to identify biologic clusters and determine biomarkers that recognize clinical COPD exacerbation phenotypes_ namely those associated with bacteria_ viruses_ or eosinophilic airway inflammation. Methods: Patients with COPD were observed for 1 year at stable and exacerbation visits. Biomarkers were measured in sputum and serum. Viruses and selected bacteria were assessed in sputum by polymerase chain reaction and routine diagnostic bacterial culture. Biologic phenotypes were explored using unbiased cluster analysis and biomarkers that differentiated clinical exacerbation phenotypes were investigated. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 145 patients (101 men and 44 women) entered the study. A total of 182 exacerbations were captured from 86 patients. Four distinct biologic exacerbation clusters were identified. These were bacterial-_ viral-_ or eosinophilic-predominant_ and a fourth associated with limited changes in the inflammatory profile termed "pauciinflammatory." Of all exacerbations_ 55%_ 29%_ and 28% were associated with bacteria_ virus_ or a sputum eosinophilia. The biomarkers that best identified these clinical phenotypes were sputum IL-1 beta_ 0.89 (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) (95% confidence interval [CI]_ 0.83-0.95); serum CXCL10_ 0.83 (95% CI_ 0.70-0.96); and percentage peripheral eosinophils_ 0.85 (95% CI_ 0.78-0.93)_ respectively. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of the biologic response of COPD exacerbations can be defined. Sputum IL-1 beta_ serum CXCL10_ and peripheral eosinophils are biomarkers of bacteria-_ virus-_ or eosinophil-associated exacerbations of COPD. Whether phenotype-specific biomarkers can be applied to direct therapy warrants further investigation.","Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu166084_7","A challenge in neuroscience is to understand the mechanisms underlying synapse formation. Most excitatory synapses in the brain are built on spines_ which are actin-rich protrusions from dendrites. Spines are a major substrate of brain plasticity_ and spine pathologies are observed in various mental illnesses. Here we investigate the role of neurobeachin (Nbea)_ a multidomain protein previously linked to cases of autism_ in synaptogenesis. We show that deletion of Nbea leads to reduced numbers of spinous synapses in cultured neurons from complete knockouts and in cortical tissue from heterozygous mice_ accompanied by altered miniature postsynaptic currents. In addition_ excitatory synapses terminate mostly at dendritic shafts instead of spine heads in Nbea mutants_ and actin becomes less enriched synaptically. As actin and synaptopodin_ a spine-associated protein with actin-bundling activity_ accumulate ectopically near the Golgi apparatus of mutant neurons_ a role emerges for Nbea in trafficking important cargo to pre- and postsynaptic compartments.","Dendritic spine formation and synaptic function require neurobeachin"

However_ a possible correlation between RBC MTX and MTXGlu2-5 concentrations and clinical outcomes of MTX treatment in RA is debated. A better understanding of the dose-concentration-time relationship of MTX and MTXGlu(2-5) in RBCs by population pharmacokinetic modelling is desirable and will facilitate assessing a potential RBC concentration-effect relationship in the future.AIM: The purpose of this analysis was to describe the pharmacokinetics of MTX and MTXGlu(2-5) in RBCs. Secondary objectives included investigation of deglutamation reactions and the loss of MTX and MTXGlu(2-5) from the RBC.METHODS: A model was developed using NONMEM(®) version 7.2 based on RBC data obtained from 48 patients with RA receiving once-weekly low-dose MTX treatment. This model was linked to a fixed two-compartment model that was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of MTX in the plasma. A series of five compartments were used to describe the intracellular pharmacokinetics of MTX and MTXGlu(2-5) in RBCs. Biologically plausible covariates were tested for a significant effect on MTX plasma clearance and the intracellular volume of distribution of all MTX species in RBCs ([Formula: see text]). The developed model was used to test hypotheses related to the enzymatic deglutamation of MTXGlu(2-5) and potential loss of MTXGlu(2-5) from RBCs.RESULTS: The final RBC pharmacokinetic model required the intracellular volumes of distribution for the parent and metabolites to be set to the value estimated for the parent drug MTX alone_ and the rate constants describing the polyglutamation steps were fixed at literature values. Significant covariates included effect of body surface area-adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate on renal plasma clearance and effect of allometrically scaled total body weight with a fixed exponent of 0.75 on non-renal plasma clearance of MTX. The only significant covariate with an effect on [Formula: see text] was mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The model supported single deglutamation steps and a single mechanism of MTX and MTXGlu(2-5) loss from RBCs.CONCLUSIONS: The developed model enabled acceptable description of the intracellular kinetics of MTX and MTXGlu(2-5) in RBCs. In the future it can form the basis of a full pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to assess the time-RBC concentration-effect relationship of low-dose MTX treatment in RA.","A population pharmacokinetic model for low-dose methotrexate and its polyglutamated metabolites in red blood cells."

Two aspects of the prolonged drive were examined: (a) changes in driving-performance measures_ physiological measures and subjective measures over the course of time_ and (b) within the drive_ variability among three different types of inter-urban road segments with different levels of attentional demands: winding road_ two-lane undivided straight road_ and a four lane divided highway. Three conclusions can be drawn from this study: (a) task-induced fatigue can occur even for drivers who are not tired or sleep deprived at the beginning of the drive_ hence the driving task itself induces fatigue. (b) Individual differences have a major influence on specific fatigue related symptoms and on when (if at all) drivers fall asleep at the wheel. (c) Drivers are active in the way they handle their performance decrement and they can adjust their fatigue-coping strategy to the demands and conditions of the drive.","Dealing with lack of exposure data in road accident analysis"

Apartfrom the type of tyre (summertyres/winter tyres without studs/winter tyres with studs)_ the year ofmanufacture_ tread depth and studprotrusion were also noted.The traffic safety effect of the use of different tyres cannot beinvestigated directly since informationconcerning tyres is not included in accident data. The effect was thereforeinvestigated by comparing twowinters before the introduction of the Law with two winters when therequirement concerning wintertyres was in force. In order to reduce the influence of other changes_control areas were used. In the northof Sweden_ practically all cars had winter tyres before the Law. There shouldtherefore be only a smallchange in tyre use. Northern Sweden can therefore be used as a control area.In order that there shouldalso be a control area in the south_ a request was made to Denmark_ wherethere had also been no changein tyre use_ if it would be possible to utilise data from there. In orderthat the effect of the Tyre Lawshould be further elucidated_ the roads in Sweden where a special winterspeed limit was in force duringthe period concerned were also excluded.

Three six-year periods from 1989 have been evaluated. RESULTS: case series dominates but randomized trials have increased somewhat. Papers on animal experiments and basic science have decreased. The most frequently reported diseases have been aortic aneurysm_ carotid artery problems_ lower extremity ischaemia and with an increasing number of papers on venous disease. Around two thirds of the presentations have been later published as full papers in European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery_ but as many as one quarter has not been published. Geographical origin has varied over time with a decrease in the UK dominance. CONCLUSION: The presentations at the Annual meeting of European Society for Vascular Surgery contribute substantially to the contents of the Society Journal but a large proportion of the presentations never appear in print.

Since the polygons are not formalized by some mathematical expressions_ it would be desirable to find continuous functions approximating them rather thoroughly in spite of their irregular shapes. An approximation by the standard curves is sometimes too rough to be a reliable source of a further analysis of the polygons. To improve the accuracy of approximating we test a continuous function_ which is composed of joined pi-class functions with seven parameters. The function_ called by us “the sampled_ truncated pi”_ is very sensitive for each little deviation in the polygon’s shape_ which allows us to classify it exactly without large errors usually accompanying a process of standard approximation.","Truncated pi-functions in Approximation of Multi-shaped Polygons"

"oai_dspace_mah_se_20438036_7","In this article the task of the teaching profession in relation to the role of the family_ both at present and in historical terms_ is discussed. Considerable changes in the tasks teachers are given have occurred within recent years. Schools have been given increasing responsibility not only for education but also for the upbringing of children. This has confronted teachers with a variety of new tasks and problems. Giving teachers much of the responsibility that parents traditionally had for the bringing up of children can be viewed against the background of a critical attitude which the pluralistic society of today has shown toward the role of parents and of the family. In the social and educational professions as these have developed_ criticisms of parents and of their manner of bringing up their children have been voiced repeatedly (Donzelot 1997_ Johansson 1993). This has been accompanied by an increasing professionalism in the care of children. Criticisms of the parental role have paved the way for an increase in the tasks the schools are given. Schools are expected to create a holistic context and a sense of citizenship based on the values generally accepted in society. This is seen as calling for more comprehensive work on the part of teachers. As a result_ teachers are faced with difficult and complex problems today. The postmodern pluralism of childhood_ with the many different forms it can take_ calls into question the demands for homogeneity_ stability and normality that institutionalised ideologies make. This confrontation between schools as they presently exist and postmodern conceptions of childhood leads to a questioning of the goal of creating normality (Hargreaves 1994). The basic aim of the project in which we are engaged is to analyze how the responsibility for reproducing the goals and content of society is divided up at present_ and has been divided up earlier_ between the home and the school. The results of two investigations are presented: - In the one study_ elementary school and preschool teachers from schools in two areas of differing socioeconomic level described in open-ended interviews their thoughts regarding their professional task_ as well as children generally_ childhood and the role of parents. That study had a clear perspective of change. Those interviewed have also been asked to report their views on the changes that had occurred in the teaching task and in the content of their profession. - The other investigation was a questionnaire study of teacher-training students in either their first or their final semester of training. The questions involved were based on statements the teachers who had taken part in the interview investigation had made. The statements made in the interview by the teachers from schools in the two areas of differing socioeconomic level_ regarding their tasks being much broader than they had been earlier_ were very much alike. It thus seems to be factors other than those of the character of the area involved that affect how changes in the role of teachers are experienced. It appeared that the flexibility of the women teachers was taken advantage of. The new expectations placed on teachers were seen to involve a redefinition of the teaching profession that those interviewed were unwilling to accept. As they expressed it the content of their work was being transformed from working with children to working increasingly with groups of adults and they explained of there being no adequate rationale for the changes that had occurred. They considered that the demands placed on them failed to correspond to certain deeply rooted conceptions of their profession_ representing a clear threat to their professional identity_ creating a sense of insecurity in their day-by-day work. They also regarded it as being a change for the worse in their professional status through its degrading their position from their being educators to their providing children help and support on an individual basis (Johansson & Pramling 2000). Those teaching at both the preschool and the primary school level provided a negative account of childhood and parenting today_ describing children as being less empathetic and less concentrated today than earlier. The preschool teachers in particular felt that children had difficulties in playing with each other_ whilst the elementary school teachers emphasised marked difficulties children had in following norms. The preschool and the elementary school teachers from the ecnomically less privileged area agreed closely with each other in describing children as being unconcentrated_ being inept in their use of language_ showing a lack of empathy and having difficulties in playing with each other. Although the elementary school and preschool teachers from schools in the economically prosperous area likewise considered childhood to be particularly problematical today_ their major criticisms differed from the views just reported. They described children as having an overly scheduled and planned existence_ one that differed from what they considered to be a happy childhood situation. They considered children to have too structured an existence and to be overly exposed to stress. The teachers as a whole felt that the conditions with which parents are faced today have changed. Parents do not have the same possibilities for bringing up their children as earlier and have partly given up the responsibilities in this respect that they once took. This result was independent of the socioeconomic status of the parents. At the same time_ two differing conceptions of the problems with which parents are faced were evident. Parents from the more well-to-do area were considered to be subjected to a high degree of stress_ to have very strong demands placed on them_ and to work so much that they were unable to spend sufficient time with their children. Parents from the more economically depressed area were considered to likewise neglect their children_ although in a different way - many of them having social problems and letting their children fend for themselves to a large extent. It was felt that the conditions for the upbringing of children in the home had declined. Teachers felt they were increasingly involved in the children's and the families' private lives and that their responsibilities toward children had increased. There appeared to be no comparable increase in the involvement of parents in matters of the preschool and elementary school education of their children. In summary_ one can say that the preschool teachers and primary school teachers from schools in both socioeconomic areas were engaged in compensatory efforts to reconstruct for their pupils more of what they regarded as being ideal childhood conditions_ involving children being provided with a calm and relaxed environment_ having more free time_ having more outdoor activities_ developing a greater degree of fantasy and greater empathy_ being better able to play with each other_ being more active physically and having greater respect both for adults and for other children. What was regarded as the most important task of the elementary school and the preschool was to provide children with a sense of self-confidence_ joy and a desire to learn. The teacher's task was seen as being a difficult one if this was combined_ in these times of reductions in educational resources_ with the need of conducting psychologically problematical discussions both with children and with their parents. Regarding the questionnaire results_ a particular concern of the teacher trainees for the problems of both children and their parents and their belief that giving children a sense of security was the foremost function of the pre-school and the elementary school alike could be noted. Among those preparing to be preschool teachers_ those in their last semester of training showed a more critical attitude towards children and their parents than those in their first semester of training. No such differences were noted_ however_ among those preparing to be elementary school teachers_ although there were differences between the first and last semester groups in the problems they emphasized and in their conceptions regarding the teaching profession and the school as an institution. We plan to relate the various patterns we discovered to questions of the content of teacher training. How do those involved in teacher training view the broadened tasks that teachers are faced by today? How is the extended responsibility for children on the part of teachers dealt with in teacher training? Are the relations of teachers to the families of the children discussed in a critical way? What position is taken toward the rights of parents to influence the schools? Teacher training has been criticized for its failure to emphasize either the importance of caring for the emotional needs of the individual child or the important role that many socioemotional relations teachers develop play (Gannerud 1999). It is often felt that during teacher training too little attention is directed at these highly important aspects of teacher work. Regardless of the socioeconomic context in which their teaching took place_ the teachers who were interviewed told of the teaching profession having changed in the direction of greater emphasis being placed on social dimensions and of the teacher's task being broadened. Despite this increase in the teachers' social responsibilities_ both in preschools and elementary schools_ this matter appeared not to have been dealt with either in their socialization to the role of being a teacher or in their teacher training. They described a conflict between professional ideologies they had come to accept_ both during their teacher training and on the basis of traditions propagated generally in their profession_ and the demands and expectations placed on them by the changed tasks they were confronted by_ one which led to a sense of uncertainty in their professional identity. The conceptions they had of what a happy childhood involves collided with how they experienced the childhood of those children with whom they had contact in their teaching. The statements of the teachers in our interviews concern a teaching profession caught up in change. The professional identity of teachers is being challenged. It is also difficult for teachers to set limits to the tasks with which they are faced. Many of the statements the teachers made can be considered to represent strategies for defining their profession_ directing criticism at the family being one way of dealing with the challenges involved and of defining their task. Strong protests against being confronted with tasks of a more social character_ involving the need of giving the individual children particular support and understanding_ can be noted. Criticism of this sort was particularly strong on the part of the elementary school teachers_ who considered the changes involved to constitute a lowering of their professional status. A sense of security was a central concept we noted in the material_ a concept clearly integrated into the institutional and professional ideology of both the preschool and the elementary school teachers_ who obviously considered that providing children with it was a major goal of their work. The tendency to think in these terms could be examined in relation to gender_ to class or to ethnicity. Both those involved in teaching and those preparing for it are predominately women_ who are given a social_ collective and normative task. Providing a sense of security can be regarded as an antidote to a sense of disorder and to the development of an increasingly pluralistic society caught up in a process of rapid change. Endeavoring to achieve a sense of security can also be viewed as a typical Swedish or Nordic cultural trait_ one that is strongly emphasized by both teachers and parents (Gullestad 1997_ Iwarsson Jansson 2001_ Kvalbein 1998_ Nikolova 2001). One can note_ finally_ that discussions of problems in a personal and thoroughgoing way with both children and their parents_ as well as considering the most important goal of education to be that of providing children a sense of security through use of educational methods that are very much individually oriented_ represent a sociopedagogical approach that is partly new. It is one that requires a considerable degree of rethinking on the part of many educators.","Det är ju ett annat jobb : Förskollärare_ grundskollärare och lärarstuderande om professionell identitet i konflikt och förändring"

METHODS: Twenty-one subjects (13 healthy and 8 mild asthmatic patients) received fluticasone propionate via a chlorofluorocarbon-propelled pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) (healthy subjects only) and Diskus and budesonide via Turbuhaler_ 1000 microg twice daily for 7 days. Intravenous doses (200 microg) of both compounds were used as references. Plasma concentrations of fluticasone and budesonide were determined during 48 h by liquid chromatography plus tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Plasma concentrations of cortisol were determined by LC-MS every second hour for 24 h at baseline_ and following each treatment. RESULTS: The volume of distribution was found to be larger and the elimination half-life and mean absorption time longer for fluticasone than for budesonide. The systemic availability of budesonide via Turbuhaler (39%) was significantly higher than that of fluticasone via Diskus (13%) (ratio 3.0 2.5_ 3.6 with 95% confidence interval CI)_ and via pMDI (21%) (ratio 1.8 1.3_ 2.3). In addition_ at steady state the systemic availability of fluticasone via pMDI was significantly higher than via Diskus (ratio 1.6 1.1_ 2.2). The lung deposition of budesonide via Turbuhaler was 2.2-fold 1.7_ 2.9 higher than that of fluticasone pMDI and 3.4-fold 2.8_ 4.0 higher than that of fluticasone Diskus. In addition_ the lung deposition of fluticasone via pMDI was 1.5-fold 1.1_ 2.9 higher than that via the Diskus inhaler. Plasma cortisol (24 h) was significantly reduced vs baseline for all three treatments. The cortisol concentration vs baseline was 12% for fluticasone pMDI_ which was significantly lower (ratio 0.32 0.24_ 0.42) than that for fluticasone Diskus (39%)_ and for budesonide Turbuhaler (46%) (ratio 0.27 0.21_ 0.37). The plasma cortisol concentration did not differ significantly between treatments with fluticasone Diskus and budesonide Turbuhaler (ratio 0.87 0.65; 1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide and fluticasone differ in their pharmacokinetic properties in that although clearance is the same_ the rate of uptake and elimination is slower for fluticasone. Despite a significantly higher pulmonary availability of budesonide via Turbuhaler_ the plasma cortisol suppression is less than that of fluticasone via pMDI and similar to that of fluticasone via Diskus. There is no indication of any difference between healthy subjects and mild asthmatic patients in the pharmacokinetics and plasma cortisol suppression of fluticasone and budesonide.","Pharmacokinetics and systemic activity of fluticasone via Diskus and pMDI_ and of budesonide via Turbuhaler"

We developed a predictive procedure to screen the mouse and human genomes and transcriptomes for cases of gene-battery-like regulation. Results: In a screen that covered &amp;SIM; 40 per cent of all annotated protein-coding genes_ we identified 21 co-expressed gene clusters with statistically supported sharing of cis- regulatory sequence elements. 66 predicted cases of over-represented transcription factor binding motifs were validated against the literature and fell into three categories: (i) previously described cases of gene battery-like regulation_ (ii) previously unreported cases of gene battery-like regulation with some support in a limited number of genes_ and (iii) predicted cases that currently lack experimental support. The novel predictions include for example Sox 17 and RFX transcription factor binding sites that were detected in &amp;SIM; 10% of all testis specific genes_ and HNF-1 and 4 binding sites that were detected in &amp;SIM; 30% of all kidney specific genes respectively. The results are publicly available at http://www.wlab.gu.se/lindahl/genebatteries. Conclusion: 21 co-expressed gene clusters were enriched for a total of 66 shared cis-regulatory sequence elements.

Most prominent are the associations with recurrent serious infections in young children and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in adults. The links with these diseases reflect the important role complement C2 plays in both innate immunity and immune tolerance. Infusions with normal fresh frozen plasma for the treatment of associated disease have demonstrated therapeutic effects but so far protein replacement therapy has not been evaluated. Results: Human complement C2 was cloned and expressed in a mammalian cell line. The purity of recombinant human C2 (rhC2) was greater than 95% and it was characterized for stability and activity. It was sensitive to C1s cleavage and restored classical complement pathway activity in C2-deficient serum both in a complement activation ELISA and a hemolytic assay. Furthermore_ rhC2 could increase C3 fragment deposition on the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae in C2-deficient serum to levels equal to those with normal serum. Conclusions: Taken together these data suggest that recombinant human C2 can restore classical complement pathway activity and may serve as a potential therapeutic for recurring bacterial infections or SLE in C2-deficient patients.","Recombinant human complement component C2 produced in a human cell line restores the classical complement pathway activity in-vitro: an alternative treatment for C2 deficiency diseases"

After absorption of the light_ the optical excitation is converted into a spin-wave excitation by a control pulse. A second control pulse reads the memory (on-demand) by reconverting the spin-wave excitation to an optical one_ where the comb structure causes a photon-echo-type rephasing of the dipole moments and directional retrieval of the light. This combination of photon-echo and spin-wave storage allows us to store submicrosecond (450 ns) pulses for up to 20 mu s.

For comparison_ the adsorption of atomic oxygen on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite has been studied under the same conditions. Graphene oxidation predominantly occurs through the formation of epoxy groups and causes atomic-scale buckling of the graphene lattice_ as evidenced by an sp(2)-to-sp(3) bonding transformation. The different parts of the graphene/metal moire superstructure show different oxidation dynamics_ with the initial formation of epoxy groups in the more bonding &quot;pores&quot;. Upon 0 adsorption_ the nearest C neighbors of epoxy groups get engaged in a stronger bonding with the substrate. As a result_ the pores of the graphene mesh become attracted and effectively pinned to the substrate by the 0 atoms. A limited intercalation of oxygen under graphene is also probable. Annealing of the samples after oxygen exposure only partially recovers the original graphene structure and results in the formation of a dense pattern of quasi-periodic_ nanometer-sized holes. Both the selective oxidization and the hole formation can be exploited for selective functionalization or tuning of the electronic properties.","Impact of Atomic Oxygen on the Structure of Graphene Formed on Ir(111) and Pt(111)"

Methods From 1974 to 1986_ 21_277 men age &lt;= 50 years in Malmo_ Sweden_ enrolled onto a cardiovascular study (74% participation). The rate of PSA screening in this population is low. According to the Swedish Cancer Registry_ 498 were later diagnosed with prostate cancer. We measured hK2_ free PSA_ and total PSA (tPSA) in archived blood plasma from 462 participants later diagnosed with prostate cancer and from 1_222 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to test for association of prostate cancer with hK2 and PSA forms measured at baseline. Results Median delay between venipuncture and prostate cancer diagnosis was 18 years. hK2 and all PSA forms were strongly associated with prostate cancer (all P &lt; .0005). None of the 90 anthropometric_ lifestyle_ biochemical_ and medical history variables measured at baseline was importantly predictive. A tPSA increase of 1 ng/mL was associated with an increase in odds of cancer of 3.69 (95% CI_ 2.99 to 4.56); addition of other PSA forms or hK2 did not add to the predictive value of tPSA. tPSA remained predictive for men diagnosed &gt;= 20 years after venipuncture_ and the predictive value remained unchanged in an analysis restricted to palpable disease. Conclusion A single PSA test at age 44 to 50 years predicts subsequent clinically diagnosed prostate cancer.

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_2206562_7","Where conservation resources are limited and conservation targets are diverse_ robust yet flexible priority-setting frameworks are vital. Priority-setting is especially important for geographically widespread species with distinct populations subject to multiple threats that operate on different spatial and temporal scales. Marine turtles are widely distributed and exhibit intra-specific variations in population sizes and trends_ as well as reproduction and morphology. However_ current global extinction risk assessment frameworks do not assess conservation status of spatially and biologically distinct marine turtle Regional Management Units (RMUs)_ and thus do not capture variations in population trends_ impacts of threats_ or necessary conservation actions across individual populations. To address this issue_ we developed a new assessment framework that allowed us to evaluate_ compare and organize marine turtle RMUs according to status and threats criteria. Because conservation priorities can vary widely (i.e. from avoiding imminent extinction to maintaining long-term monitoring efforts) we developed a &quot;conservation priorities portfolio&quot; system using categories of paired risk and threats scores for all RMUs (n = 58). We performed these assessments and rankings globally_ by species_ by ocean basin_ and by recognized geopolitical bodies to identify patterns in risk_ threats_ and data gaps at different scales. This process resulted in characterization of risk and threats to all marine turtle RMUs_ including identification of the world&#39;s 11 most endangered marine turtle RMUs based on highest risk and threats scores. This system also highlighted important gaps in available information that is crucial for accurate conservation assessments. Overall_ this priority-setting framework can provide guidance for research and conservation priorities at multiple relevant scales_ and should serve as a model for conservation status assessments and priority-setting for widespread_ long-lived taxa.","Global Conservation Priorities for Marine Turtles"

Objectives: To determine the feasibility of dosing Haemate P-(R) VWF/factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate based on pharmacokinetics (PK) in the management of surgical subjects with VWD. Methods: VWD subjects scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled in a prospective multicenter open-label cohort study. A pre-operative loading dose of VWF/FVIII concentrate based upon prior individual subject PK analysis was administered followed by postoperative therapeutic/maintenance infusions. Results: Twenty-eight subjects with types 1_ 2A or 3 VWD and one with type 2 M were enrolled. Median in vivo recovery of VWF ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) was 1.9 IU dL(-1) (IU kg(-1))(-1) with an interquartile range (IQR) of 1.6-2.5 IU dL(-1) (IU kg(-1))(-1). Median response_ half-life and clearance were 74.0% (IQR_ 55.5-100%)_ 15.6 h (IQR_ 9.0-28.4 h) and 3.26 mL kg(-1) h(-1) (IQR_ 2.29-5.21 mL kg(-1) h(-1))_ respectively. A PK-guided median VWF:RCo loading dose of 62.4 IU kg(-1) (IQR_ 50.1-87.0 IU kg(-1)) was administered. Postoperative mean trough VWF:RCo levels of 62-73 IU dL(-1) were sufficient to prevent bleeding. Investigators rated hemostasis excellent or good in 96.3% of subjects on the day of surgery and 100% on the next day and on day 14. A subject with multiple risk factors developed pulmonary embolism_ which resolved without sequelae. Conclusions: Haemate P-(R) provided effective and safe hemostasis in VWD subjects undergoing elective surgery.

The impact crater is an important target of the project &quot;Concentric Impact Structures in the Palaeozoic&quot; within the framework of the &quot;Swedish Deep Drilling Program&quot;. Two core sections_ Mora 001 and Solberga 1_ have been analysed. The sedimentary successions of these core sections include strata of late Tremadocian through late Wenlock ages. Our preliminary studies show not only that several of the classical Palaeozoic units of Sweden are represented in the area_ but also that other significantly different facies are preserved in the Siljan district. An erosional unconformity representing a substantial hiatus occurs between Middle Ordovician limestone and a Llandovery-Wenlock (Silurian) shale succession in the western part of the Siljan structure and suggests an extended period of uplift and erosion. This may be related to forebulge migration due to flexural loading by the Caledonian thrust sheet to the west. Thus_ this part of Sweden_ previously regarded as a stable cratonic area_ presumably was affected by the Caledonian collision between Baltica and Laurentia.","New Ordovician-Silurian drill cores from the Siljan impact structure in central Sweden: an integral part of the Swedish Deep Drilling Program"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_3124487_7","Migraine is a neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral headaches accompanied by nausea_ vomiting_ photophobia and phonophobia. Current theories suggest that the initiation of a migraine attack involves a primary event in the central nervous system (CNS)_ probably involving a combination of genetic changes in ion channels and environmental changes_ which renders the individual more sensitive to environmental factors; this may_ in turn_ result in a wave of cortical spreading depression (CSD) when the attack is initiated. Genetically_ migraine is a complex familial disorder in which the severity and the susceptibility of individuals are most likely governed by several genes that vary between families. Early PET studies have suggested the involvement of a migraine active region in the brainstem. Migraine headache is associated with trigeminal nerve activation and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from the trigeminovascular system. Administration of triptans (5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists) causes the headache to subside and the levels of CGRP to normalize. Moreover_ administration of CGRP receptor antagonists aborts the headache. Recent immunohistochemical and pharmacological results suggest that the trigeminal system has receptors for CGRP; further_ 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors_ which inhibit the action of CGRP in pain transmission when activated_ have been demonstrated. This offers an explanation for the treatment response. The present review provides an updated analysis of the basic mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of migraine and the various pharmacological approaches (including 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists_ CGRP receptor antagonists and glutamate receptor antagonists) that have shown efficacy for the acute treatment of this disorder.","Basic mechanisms of migraine and its acute treatment."

To elucidate the underlying molecular biology_ we examined the changes in gastric gene expression in both types of achlorhydria. We also explored the associated changes in the gastric microflora and the long-term consequences of gastrin-deficient achlorhydria. Methods: Expression profiles were generated from gastric RNA from wild-type mice_ gastrin knockout (KO) mice_ gastrin KO mice after I week of gastrin infusion_ and wild-type mice treated for I month with a proton pump inhibitor. The results were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immuno-histochemistry. Selective media were used to characterize the gastric microflora. Results: The number of gastric bacteria was increased in both gastrin KO and PPI-treated mice. The expression profiles revealed activation of immune defense genes_ interferon-regulated response genes_ and intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa. In young gastrin-deficient mice_ gastrin infusions reversed the changes. Over time_ the changes accumulated_ became irreversible_ and progressed into metaplasia and polyp development. Finally_ the study showed that gastrin regulated the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. Conclusions: Independently of gastrin_ achlorhydria is associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth and intestinal gene expression patterns and is associated with predisposition to disease. Gastrin is therefore essential for prevention of gastric disease_ mainly through control of acid secretion but to a lesser extent also through control of gastric gene expression. The gastrin-deficient mouse serves as a useful new model for gastric metaplasia and neoplasia.","Gastric inflammation_ metaplasia_ and tumor development in gastrin-deficient mice"

Uncertainties regarding key morphological characters have resulted in numerous revisions and redescriptions of the species with much of the taxonomic shuffling occurring before the mid-20(th) century. A major problem with the early documentation of acrotretide brachiopods is that many species were described in the days before the advent of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)_ resulting in dubious interpretations of significant morphological characteristics_ like the position of the pedicle foramen and the internal morphology of both valves. A detailed revision of Acrotreta species resulted in the proposal that the genus is restricted solely to the Ordovician with the Bornholm acrotretide species subsequently left floating in taxonomic limbo. Recent taxonomic suggestions have been provisional_ awaiting morphological information based on type or topotype material. The examination of topotype material in addition to supplementary material collected from southern Sweden has elucidated many of the previous ambiguous morphological characteristics of the species confirming that the original description was based on more than one brachiopod species. The new morphological information acquired here has resulted in the erection of a new acrotretid genus_ Clupeafumosus gen. nov._ to accommodate the material previously described as Acrotreta socialis. Co-occurring with Clupeafumosus socialis in southern Sweden is another new acrotretide brachiopod_ Monophthalma andersoni sp. nov._ which is additionally described.","Reappraisal of the brachiopod Acrotreta socialis von Seebach_ 1865: clarifying 150 years of confusion"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_40709_7","Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA) is a disorder characterised by multiple strokes in young adults_ resulting in paralysis and dementia. The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the peptidase inhibitor cystatin C. The mutation causes an amino acid substitution Leu68 -&gt; Gln in cystatin C (L68Q cystatin C) which results in deposition of the protein in the blood vessels in the brain. The overall goal of this study was to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms leading to amyloid deposition in patients suffering from HCCAA. This was addressed by studying factors involved in the regulation of cystatin C expression and the behaviour of the L68Q variant in different cellular systems and clinical samples. When studying factors involved in cystatin C gene regulation we found that the steroid dexamethasone causes a significant and dose-dependent increase in cystatin C secretion from cultivated HeLa cells_ up to a maximal increase of 80% at biological levels of the steroid. When looking at monocytes isolated from HCCAA patients and transfected mouse and human neuroblastoma cells we saw_ in all cells tested_ that the mutated cystatin C was secreted_ but at a significantly lower rate than the wildtype protein. An increased accumulation of cystatin C was seen in all transfected cells expressing the gene encoding L68Q cystatin C. The accumulated L68Q cystatin C is insoluble and located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. When studying human neuroblastoma cell-lines we saw that they expressed and secreted very high levels of cystatin C compared to other human cell-lines tested. The neuroblastoma cells were also different from other cell types in that they showed intracellular insoluble wildtype cystatin C. Finally we investigated the turnover of cystatin C in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HCCAA patients. Both L68Q and wildtype cystatin C were found in plasma from these patients but only the wildtype cystatin C could be detected in CSF.","L68Q cystatin C: Expression_ cellular transport and turnover of the cystatin C variant forming amyloid in patients with Hereditary Cystatin C Amyloid Angiopaty (HCCAA)"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_40709_7","Sjukdomen ärftlig hjärnblödning med cystatin C-amyloid angiopati (engelsk förkortning_ HCCAA) beror på att en ärftlig mutation i genomet förändrar en byggsten (aminosyra) i proteinet cystatin C. Cystatin C-varianten som uppkommer deponeras som olösligt material (amyloid) i blodkärlens väggar och leder till att dessa ofta brister före 40-årsåldern med hjärnblödning som följd. Cystatin C som hör till cystatinfamiljen av proteiner_ består av 120 aminosyror och har som normal funktion att hämma enzymerna cathepsin B_ H_ L_ K och S. Den aminosyra som bytts ut hos patienter med HCCAA är leucin i position 68 som i stället är glutaminsyreamid (L68Q). Mutationen som leder till L68Q-utbytet förekommer hos alla undersökta patienter men hos inga icke-drabbade individer och måste därför vara ansvarig för sjukdomen. Analys av DNA kan därför användas för att säkert ställa diagnosen HCCAA. For att kunna behandla HCCAA måste vi försöka förstå hur ett enstaka aminosyrautbyte hos cystatin C kan orsaka amyloid-deponering och tidig död i hjärnblödning hos de drabbade individerna. Detta har varit målet med mitt avhandlingsarbete. Om denna mekanism kunde utrönas skulle inte endast behandlingsmöjligheter kunna öppna sig för patienter med HCCAA_ utan kanske även för patienter med andra amyloidos-sjukdomar_ som t.ex. Alzheimers sjukdom. I avhandlingens delarbete I_ studerade vi hur cystatin C-genen regleras_ med förhoppningen att finna sätt att nedreglera produktionen av L68Q cystatin C. Men när vi odlade celler (HeLa-celler) tillsammans med biologiska mängder av steroiden dexametason ökade produktion av cystatin C med nästan 80%. Det ser ut som steroider påverkar cystatin C-genen indirekt_ genom att påverka produktionen av andra proteiner som i sin tur påverkar cystatin C-genen. Vilka proteiner det gäller är inte känt. För att kunna bedöma betydelsen av detta_ måste vi undersöka cystatin C-halter i olika biologiska vätskor hos personer som har ökade mängder dexametason i kroppen. För att kunna jämföra olika egenskaper hos L68Q cystatin C och normalt cystatin C_ studerade vi i delarbeten II-IV olika celler som producerar cystatin C. I delarbete II studerade vi cystatin C i monocyter (blodceller) som vi extraherade från HCCAA-patienter och jämförde det med cystatin C i monocyter från normala blodgivare. Vi kom fram till att cellulära transporten av L68Q cystatin C sannolikt är påverkad_ eftersom mindre mängder av cystatin C utsöndras från HCCAA-patienters celler. Alla patienter är heterozygoter när det gäller cystatin C (kan producera både normalt cystatin C och L68Q cystatin C)_ därför var det svårt att säga om cellerna från patienterna utsöndrade båda proteintyperna (L68Q och normalt cystatin C) eller om det är bara det normala proteinet som kommer ut och variant stannar kvar inne i cellen. För att försöka besvara den frågan förde vi i delarbete III in genen för L68Q cystatin C i musceller (som inte producerar något humant cystatin C) och jämförde med musceller som tillförts gener för normalt humant cystatin C. Vi såg att L68Q cystatin C kan utsöndras men en del av proteinet stannar och ackumuleras i cellen. Om det är ackumulerat L68Q cystatin C eller utsöndrat L68Q cystatin C som deponeras i kärlväggar hos HCCAA-patienter och orsakar hjärnblödning eller båda två_ kan vi inte säga något om än så länge. För att studera om neuroendocrina celler (som det finns många av i hjärnan) är ansvariga för produktion av en stor del av det L68Q cystatin C som bildar amyloid i hjärnan_ studerade vi deras omsättning av cystatin C i delarbete IV. Det visade sig att alla undersökta neuroblastomceller_ producerade stora mängder av cystatin C jämfört med andra typer av undersökta celler. För att studera omsättningen av L68Q cystatin C i sådana celler satte vi in genen för L68Q-varianten i en typ av neuroblastomcell och jämförde dessa med celler som tillförts genen för normalt humant cystatin C. Det visade sig att celler som tillförts L68Q cystatin C-genen utsöndrade mindre mängder av cystatin C än de som tillförts en extra normal cystatin C-gen. Detta visar att resultaten från delarbete III också gäller för humana celler. Delarbete IV visade också att normalt cystatin C producerat av neuroblastomceller har annorlunda omsättning än cystatin C i andra undersökta celler. Neuroblastomcellers höga cystatin C-koncentration inne i cellen och annorlunda omsättning av proteinet kan ha betydelse för processen som leder till amyloid-deponering av L68Q cystatin C i blodkärlens väggar hos HCCAA-patienter. Vi och andra har visat att L68Q cystatin C kan utsöndras från odlade celler men L68Q cystatin C har aldrig påvisats i biologiska vätskor från HCCAA-patienter. I delarbete V_ undersökte vi om det går att hitta L68Q cystatin C i blod eller spinalvätska från HCCAA-patienter. Blod och spinalvätska innehåller väldigt många proteiner_ därför var det svårt att rena fram cystatin C som fanns i dessa vätskor. Vi kunde slutligen hitta L68Q cystatin C i blod men inte i spinalvätska från HCCAA-patienter. Detta bevisar att normalt utsöndras L68Q cystatin C ut i kroppsvätskor. Anledningen till att det inte gick att hitta L68Q cystatin C i spinalvätska kan vara att proteinet redan har aggregerat och deponerats.","L68Q cystatin C: Expression_ cellular transport and turnover of the cystatin C variant forming amyloid in patients with Hereditary Cystatin C Amyloid Angiopaty (HCCAA)"

This is the eighth in a series of papers dedicated to presenting Galileo and Ulysses dust data. We present data from the Galileo dust instrument for the period January 1997-December 1999 when the spacecraft completed 21 revolutions about Jupiter. In this time interval data were obtained as high resolution realtime science data or recorded data during 449 days (representing 41% of the entire period)_ or via memory readouts during the remaining times. Because the data transmission rate of the spacecraft was very low_ the complete data set (i.e. all parameters measured by the instrument during impact of a dust particle) of only 3% (7625) of all particles detected could be transmitted to Earth; the other particles were only counted. Together with the data of 2883 particles detected during_ Galileo&#39;s interplanetary cruise and 53 53 particles detected in the jovian system in 1996_ complete data of 15 861 particles detected by the Galileo dust instrument from 1989 to 1999 are now available. The majority of the detected particles were tiny grains (about 10 nm in radius)_ most of them originating from Jupiter&#39;s innermost Galilean moon Io. They were detected throughout the jovian system and the highest impact rates exceeded 100 min(-1) (C21 orbit; 01 July 1999). With the new data set the times of onset_ cessation and a 180 degrees shift in the impact direction of the grains measured during 19 Galileo orbits about Jupiter are well reproduced by simulated 9 nm particles charged up to a potential of +3 V_ confirming earlier results obtained for only two Galileo orbits (Horanyi_ M._ Grun_ E._ Heck_ A._ 1997. Modeling the Galileo dust measurements at Jupiter. Geophys. Res. Lett. 24_ 2175-2178). Galileo has detected a large number of bigger particles mostly in the region between the Galilean moons. The average radius of 370 of these grains measured in the 1996-1999 period is about 2 mu m (assuming spherical grains with density 1 g cm(-3)) and the size distribution rises steeply towards smaller grains. The biggest detected particles have a radius of about 10 mu m. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Galileo dust data from the jovian system: 1997-1999"

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_544543_7","Temperature is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter used to describe physical_ chemical and biological processes. Much effort is made to measure temperature accurately in a wide variety of applications_ making temperature one of the most extensively measured parameters. In combustion as in many other applications_ temperature plays a substantial role in helping to maintain an efficient and clean environment. Being able to measure temperature accurately in combustion and in fire-related applications is important for giving a better understanding of heat transfer phenomena and improving existing models. A method based on the spectroscopy of inorganic luminescent materials is described here and is employed in experiments related to combustion. The method involves use of thermographic phosphors which enable remote temperature diagnostics to be performed with a high degree of sensitivity and accuracy. The technique is superior to those based on thermocouples and pyrometry_ particularly in the vicinity of flames and when the measured surface is subjected to random movements. Thermographic phosphors are applied here to temperature measurements in one-point and in two-dimensions within flamespread scenarios. Results obtained in this small-scale flamespread scenario served as input data to various subprojects within the framework of a more extensive flamespread project. The technique was also employed in pyrolysis experiments involving different construction materials and polymers. The experiments included simultaneous measurements of surface temperature and mass-loss rate for the verification of a pyrolysis model applied to the decomposition of these materials. Thermographic phosphors have the property of being insensitive to variations in pressure up to 1 GPa. This property extends the use and development of thermographic thermometry to other domains_ such as internal combustion engines. Surface temperatures of the piston and valves of gasoline engines of the direct-injection type were investigated. The temperature was measured at one point and in two dimensions inside the combustion chamber. The results suggest that developing the technique for thermometry of diesel engine pistons could be promising. Simultaneous measurements of piston temperature were performed with use of thermographic phosphors and thermocouples. The complex procedures required to implement the use of thermocouples inside an engine make thermocouples an expensive choice_ especially with the only very limited possibilities this provides of investigating different engine geometries and components. Thermographic phosphors were also employed in gas turbine applications. Temperature imaging of the afterburner of a full-size aircraft engine was performed in combination with fuel visualisation by use of laser-induced fluorescence. The experiments were aimed at studying the effects of various engine loads on wall temperatures and fuel efficiency. Thermographic phosphors were used to study the temperature of droplets in relation to spray generation. In spray dynamics_ temperature is a crucial parameter for gaining an understanding of atomisation_ of evaporation and of heat convection from the surrounding gases. Although the technique is in first stage of its development_ promising results for mono-dispersed droplets and sprays were obtained.","Thermometry Using Laser-Induced Emission from Thermographic Phosphors: Development and Applications in Combustion"

AAT is found in a native_ inhibitory active form_ but also in other_ non-inhibitory forms including cleaved and/or degraded. To test a hypothesis that AAT dependent on its molecular form may have multiple effects on tumour cell behaviour_ breast cancer cells_ MDA-MB 468_ were cultured alone or stimulated with a native AAT or its C-terminal fragment (C-36) at a concentration of 5mumol/l = for 2_ 24 and 48 hours.

"oai_publications_ki_se_1061638797_7","Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic cells of the innate immune system. They have been found to be critical in the defense against infections and also against some tumors. Recent studies have shown that NK cells require signals from accessory cells to induce their recruitment and activation at the site of infection or tumor growth. One group of these accessory cells is the family of dendritic cells (DC). DC are antigen presenting cells_ acting as sensors of the immune system with the capacity to activate the adaptive immune responses Thus_ DC have been called nature s adjuvants. In the last fifteen years_ another feature of DC have been under investigation_ namely their interaction with NK cells_ which can influence the outcome of the adaptive immune responses. In this thesis I have investigated different aspects of the interactions between NK cells and DC_ including killing of DC and DC-induced activation of NK cells. Immature resting DC are killed by activated NK cells. However_ when toll like receptors (TLR) are stimulated on DC_ they become functionally mature and become more resistant to NK cell mediated killing. In my first study_ I investigated the role of the non-classical MHC class I molecule Qa1 in the reduced susceptibility of mature DC to NK cell lysis. We found that the interaction between Qa1 on mature DC with its inhibitory receptor NKG2A/CD94 on NK cells was crucial in protecting mature DC from NK cell-mediated killing both in vitro and in vivo_ even in the absence of classical MHC class I molecules. However_ mature DC were only protected from NK cells expressing NKG2A inhibitory receptor since NKG2A- NK cells lacking this molecule also displayed cytotoxicity against mature DC. In addition to the elimination of DC by NK cells_ another consequence of NK-DC interaction was investigated in this thesis_ namely how TLR-stimulated DC activate NK cells. DC are no longer considered to be a homogenous cell type_ instead several subtypes have been described both in mice and humans. Bone-marrow derived DC grown in GM-CSF have been mostly used in reported studies and also in paper I and III of this thesis. In paper II we explored another DC subtype_ the plasmacytoid DC (pDC)_ that we suggest may be more potent in recruiting and activating NK cells in peripheral tissue. CpG-activated pDC injected i.p. in mice induced strong recruitment of NK cells to the peritoneal cavity_ which was in part dependent on CXCR3 and CD62L. The recruited NK cells were also activated in terms of cytotoxicity against the classical NK cell target YAC-1 and were able to produce IFNgamma after restimulation ex vivo. The costimulatory molecules CD28-CD80/86 were involved in the activation of NK cells induced by stimulated pDC. Finally_ an infectious model consisting of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) was used to investigate NK cells interaction with parasite-infected DC. T. gondii-infected DC were extremely sensitive to NK cell mediated lysis_ which required infection with live parasites. After lysis of infected DC_ parasites rapidly re-infected effector NK cells. In vivo_ NK cells were found to be readily infected with T. gondii following inoculation of T. gondii-infected DC or free parasites_ which was significantly reduced in mice lacking killing machinery. We speculate that NK cells kill infected DC that leads to re-infection of the NK cells and that this actually may be beneficial for the parasite to induce chronicity in its host. In summary_ this thesis provides some new insights in events that take place during NK cells interaction with DC. Hopefully_ the work presented here may be beneficial in the attempts to improve therapies targeting these cells in the future.","NK cell and dendritic cell interactions in innate immune responses"

It was originally developed for treatment of lymphomas as a targeted therapy against CD20 positive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). More recently_ its use has expanded into patients with rheumatic diseases. Consistent with this trend_ late adverse events of rituximab are appearing_ one of these is rituximab induced neutropenia also called late-onset neutropenia (LON). It is defined as an unexplained absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.5 x 109/L occurring 4 weeks after termination of rituximab therapy up to one year of the follow-up time. However_ incidence_ mechanism_ predisposing factors and clinical consequences of LON are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to address these questions in rituximab treated patients for NHL and rheumatic disease. We studied the incidence of LON retrospectively in rituximab treated NHL patients. We found an incidence of 8% and a higher incidence was observed in autologous stem cell transplanted patients (Paper I). In this study we observed maturation arrest at the (pro)myelocyte stage of granulopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) implying a selective depletion of granulocytes. There was no incidence report in rheumatic patients and hence we expanded our studies into this patient group (Paper II). We found similar incidence figure. However_ the clinical course of LON was different and it was associated with a higher risk of infections. Moreover_ flow cytometry studies on peripheral blood showed that LON patients had pronounced and longer Blymphocyte depletion compared with non-LON matched controls. Lower IgM levels were evident in LON patients. Thus_ the levels of B-lymphocyte depletion and IgM levels may identify patients at risk. Subsequently_ we tried to define genetic factors for LON by analyzing polymorphisms affecting B-lymphocyte depletion and production (Paper III). Here_ we studied the role of Fc gamma receptor (FCGR: FCGR2A 131 H/R_ FCGR2B 232 I/T and FCGR3A 176 V/F) and B-lymphocyte activating (BAFF: -871C/T) gene promoter polymorphisms for the development of LON. The FCGR3A 176V allele was correlated with the occurrence of LON and each V allele was associated with 4-fold increase of odds-ratio for LON. Moreover_ patients with this genotype had a longer time to flare of rheumatic disease. Surprisingly_ patients who developed LON had also a longer time to flare demonstrating a novel correlation between LON and clinical response. In Paper IV_ we tried to elucidate mechanisms of LON. We included rituximab treated NHL patients prospectively. BM and blood samples were obtained at the detection of LON. A pronounced B-lymphocyte depletion in LON patients was also evident during the LON period and this coincided with significant raise in serum BAFF levels compared to non-LON matched controls. Furthermore_ BM studies revealed a selective depletion of granulopoiesis (maturation arrest at the (pro)myelocyte) stage during complete B-lymphocyte depletion. In summary_ our studies add to our understanding of LON as a distinct entity. The identification of risk factors such as levels of B-lymphocyte depletion and IgM_ and possession of the high affinity FCGR3A 176 V allele might be helpful in future clinical practice. Moreover_ this genotype as well as the presence of LON were also related to a better clinical outcome. It is_ thus_ tempting to suggest that LON is a good prognostic factor_ but that remains to be proven in a larger prospective studies and lymphoma patients. Finally_ our mechanistic studies highlight the interdependence of lymphopoiesis and granulopoiesis which might be orchestrated by BAFF.","Rituximab-induced neutropenia : clinical and patophysiological studies"

Such a map may be experimentally obtained from polarized neutron diffraction (PND) data or theoretically calculated using quantum chemical approaches. Density functional theory (DFT) methods have been proved to be well-adapted for this. Spin distributions in one-dimensional compounds may also be computed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) formalism. These three approaches_ PND_ DFT_ and DMRG_ have been utilized to obtain new insights on the ground state of two antiferromagnetically coupled Mn2+Cu2+ compounds_ namely [Mn(Me-6-[14]ane-N-4)Cu(oxpn)](CF3SO3)(2) and MnCu(pba)(H2O)(3) . 2H(2)O_ with Me-6-[14]ane-N-4 = (+/-)-5_7_7_12_14_14-hexamethyl-1_4_8_11-tetraazacyclotetradecane_ oxpn = N_N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)oxamido and pba = 1_3-propylenebis(oxamato). Three problems in particular have been investigated: the spin distribution in the mononuclear precursors [Cu(oxpn)] and [Cu(pba)](2-)_ the spin density maps in the two Mn2+Cu2+ compounds_ and the evolution of the spin distributions on the Mn2+ and Cu2+ sites when passing from a pair to a one-dimensional ferrimagnet.","Spin distributions in antiferromagnetically coupled Mn2+Cu2+ systems: from the pair to the infinite chain"

In this study_ we investigated the effect of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) palmitate_ stearate_ myristate and laurate_ and the unsaturated fatty acid linoleate_ on the production of proinflammatory cytokines in phorbol ester-differentiated THP-1 cells_ a model of human macrophages. Palmitate induced secretion and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha_ IL-8 and IL-1 beta_ and enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1 beta secretion. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion was also induced by stearate_ but not by the shorter chain SFA_ myristate and laurate_ or linoleate. Triacsin C abolished the palmitate-induced cytokine secretion_ suggesting that palmitate activation to palmitoyl-CoA is required for its effect. Palmitate-induced cytokine secretion was decreased by knockdown of serine palmitoyltransferase and mimicked by C(2)-ceramide_ indicating that ceramide is involved in palmitate-induced cytokine secretion. Palmitate phosphorylated p38 and JNK kinases_ and blocking of these kinases with specific inhibitors diminished the palmitate-induced cytokine secretion. Palmitate also activated the AP-1 (c-Jun) transcription factor. Knockdown of MyD88 reduced the palmitate-induced IL-8_ but not TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta secretion. In conclusion_ our data suggest that the long-chain SFA induce proinflammatory cytokines in human macrophages via pathways involving de novo ceramide synthesis. This might contribute to the activation of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques_ especially in type 2 diabetes.","Induction of proinflammatory cytokines by long-chain saturated fatty acids in human macrophages."
"oai_services_scigloo_org_119802_7","In this paper_ a detailed linearization procedure for dynamic load modulation (DLM) transmitter architectures is proposed for the first time. Compared with the conventional single-input/single-output digital predistortion (DPD) approach used with traditional power amplifiers (PAs)_ the proposed linearization scheme is based on a regular memory DPD in combination with an efficiency-optimized static one-to-two mapping inverse model_ which constructs the predistorted input signals to the DLM transmitter. The time-alignment issue_ which is very important to this dual-input architecture_ is also considered. The proposed technique is demonstrated by a 1-GHz 10-W LDMOS PA that employs a varactor-based tunable matching network. A normalized mean square error of $-{hbox {35 dB}}$_ and adjacent channel leakage ratio of $-hbox{43 dBc}$ is achieved_ with an average power-added efficiency of 53% for a single-carrier WCDMA signal with 7-dB peak-to-average ratio. Finally_ it is shown that the time-alignment sensitivity is relaxed when the proposed linearization scheme is used. This means that the overall complexity of the transmitter implementation can be reduced.","Linearization of Efficiency-Optimized Dynamic Load Modulation Transmitter Architectures"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_124847_7","To define pre-crash scenarios for evaluation of active safety functions_ data from crash investigations is often used. Typical data sources include official databases with police reported crashes (macroscopic data) and in-depth case studies (microscopic data). Macroscopic data is often representative but has little detail on causation_ while the opposite is true of microscopic data. Combining the sources by coupling causation information from a set of case studies to a macroscopic crash type would therefore seem ideal. For the coupling to be valid however_ it must be verified that the selected case study set is representative of the crash type. The aim of this study is to describe and test a new methodology for such verification by means of an intermediate layer of representatively sampled crash information (questionnaire responses from crash involved drivers). The methodology was applied to intersection crashes. For the data sets used_ the similarity in crash causation for case studies and questionnaire crashes_ together with the context similarity for questionnaire crashes and the macroscopic crash type_ was sufficient to argue that the case studies were representative of the crash type. While results must be considered preliminary given the limited data sets used_ the proposed methodology shows promise for future work related to defining pre-crash scenarios for ADAS evaluation.

This system can be induced by galactose and is repressed by glucose. Since S. cerevisiae prefers glucose as a carbon source_ and since its growth rate is higher in glucose than in galactose-containing media_ we compared and evaluated seven different promoters expressed during growth on glucose (pTEF1_ pADH1_ pTPI1_ pHXT7_ pTDH3_ pPGK1 and pPYK1) with two strong galactose-induced promoters (pGAL1 and pGAL10)_ using lacZ as a reporter gene and measuring LacZ activity in batch and continuous cultivation. TEF1 and PGK1 promoters showed the most constant activity pattern at different glucose concentrations. Based on these results_ we designed and constructed two new expression vectors which contain the two constitutive promoters_ TEF1 and PGK1_ in opposite orientation to each other. These new vectors retain all the features from the pESC-URA plasmid except that gene expression is mediated by constitutive promoters.","Characterization of different promoters for designing a new expression vector in Saccharomyces cerevisiae"

The Workshop addressed two critical questions: first whether_ with current knowledge_ it would be possible to define a consensus set of mucosal sampling methods to facilitate cross-species comparisons and ensure standardized implementation in clinical trials; second to determine the remaining challenges (technical and logistical) and their possible solutions for assessing mucosal responses to HIV-1 vaccines.","Assessment of mucosal immunity to HIV-1."

Ambient air_ exhaust air_ soil and rock are the most common heat source types. Data on COP_ investment costs_ working fluids_ present Swedish market etc. for these types of heat sources are given. Data on industrial heat pump installations in some countries and distribution of these according to heat pump type and industry sector as well as heat source temperatures are reported.

Finally_ the influence on the economy of the heat source temperature is presented. The cost-effectiveness of heat pumps for reducing CO2 emissions compared with other heating technologies is discussed. The main results are: (1) heat pumps can in many cases in the future contribute to a reduction of CO2; (2) there is a rather big difference_ for larger systems a major difference_ between the water-based and the ambient air-based heat pumps in terms of efficient reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.","Heat sources - technology_ economy and environment"

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of Gal-3 in human tongue cancer progression. Methods: Human tongue cancer cell lines (SCC-4 and CAL27) were transfected with a small-interfering RNA against Gal-3 (Gal-3-siRNA). The migration and invasion of the cells were examined using a scratch assay and BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber_ respectively. The mRNA and protein levels of β-catenin_ Akt/pAkt_ GSK-3β/pGSK-3β_ MMP-9 in the cells were measured using RT-PCR and Western blotting_ respectively. Results: Transient silencing of Gal-3 gene for 48 h significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of both SCC-4 and CAL27 cells. Silencing of Gal-3 gene significantly decreased the protein level of β-catenin_ leaving the mRNA level of β-catenin unaffected. Furthermore_ silencing Gal-3 gene significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3β_ and suppressed the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9 in the cells. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Gal-3 mediates the migration and invasion of tongue cancer cells in vitro via regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and Akt phosphorylation.","Galectin-3 gene silencing inhibits migration and invasion of human tongue cancer cells in vitro via downregulating beta-catenin"

As most mutations likely occur randomly_ cancer driver mutations can only be found if they are recurrent. Here we use exome sequencing of the mouse cell lines Panc02_ L1210 and Colon 26 to identify genetic alterations (single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertion and deletions) that occurred in three different strains of mice and that resulted in tumorigenesis. We identify known mutations in genes like Kras_ Cdkn2a/b_ Smad4 and Trp53 and a large list of genes whose causal link to cancer is unknown. Interestingly_ by screening a compound library we find that the identified oncogenic Kras mutation in Colon 26 cells correlates with its sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis of these mouse tumor exomes show that their manageable number of mutations could facilitate the identification of novel mutations or pathways driving tumor development. Furthermore_ their use as tools is now enhanced as they can be used to create syngenic transplant models for utilization in drug discovery and validation. Finally_ by showing that Kras mutant Colon 26 cells are sensitive to MEK inhibitors_ we provide one proof-of-principle experiment that a platform containing targeted resequencing and drug screens could be a valuable addition in the clinic to devise anti-cancer drug schemes.","Identification of tumorigenic and therapeutically actionable mutations in transplantable mouse tumor cells by exome sequencing."
"oai_services_scigloo_org_201365_7","We present results from a comprehensive survey of 70 radio galaxies at redshifts 1 < z < 5 : 2 using the PACS and SPIRE instruments on board the Herschel Space Observatory. Combined with existing mid-IR photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope_ published 870 mu m photometry_ and new observations obtained with LABOCA on the APEX telescope_ the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in our sample are continuously covered across 3.6-870 mu m. The total 8-1000 mu m restframe infrared luminosities of these radio galaxies are such that almost all of them are either ultra-(L-tot(IR) > 10(12) L-circle dot) or hyper-luminous (L-tot(IR) > 10(13) L-circle dot) infrared galaxies. We fit the infrared SEDs with a set of empirical templates which represent dust heated by a variety of starbursts (SB) and by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the SEDs of radio galaxies require the dust to be heated by both AGN and SB_ but the luminosities of these two components are not strongly correlated. Assuming empirical relations and simple physical assumptions_ we calculate the star formation rate (SFR)_ the black hole mass accretion rate ((M) over dot(BH))_ and the black hole mass (M-BH) for each radio galaxy. We find that the host galaxies and their black holes are growing extremely rapidly_ having SFR approximate to 100-5000 M-circle dot yr(-1) and. (M) over dot(BH) approximate to 1-100 M(circle dot)yr(-1). The mean specific SFRs (sSFR) of radio galaxies at z > 2 : 5 are higher than the sSFR of typical star forming galaxies over the same redshift range_ but are similar or perhaps lower than the galaxy population for radio galaxies at z < 2.5. By comparing the sSFR and the specific. (M) over dot(BH) (s(M) over dot(BH))_ we conclude that black holes in radio loud AGN are already_ or soon will be_ overly massive compared to their host galaxies in terms of expectations from the local M-BH-M-Gal relation. In order to catch up with the black hole_ the galaxies require about an order of magnitude more time to grow in mass at the observed SFRs compared to the time the black hole is actively accreting. However_ during the current cycle of activity_ we argue that this catching up is likely to be difficult because of the short gas depletion times. Finally_ we speculate on how the host galaxies might grow sufficiently in stellar mass to ultimately fall onto the local MBH-MGal relation.","Rapidly growing black holes and host galaxies in the distant Universe from the Herschel Radio Galaxy Evolution Project"

OBJECTIVE: To assess concordance between patients' and physicians' estimations of the risks of hypertension and benefits of treatment during a regular follow-up appointment. DESIGN: A population-based Swedish multicentre study. Patients were included consecutively from a randomized selection of centres (55 primary health care centres and 11 clinics of internal medicine). METHODS: A questionnaire was given to 1013 patients undergoing their individually prescribed antihypertensive therapy and 212 physicians who were caring for these patients. RESULTS: Without therapy_ patients perceived the risks of cardiovascular complications to be higher than did their physicians. Patients were not aware that an increasing number of risk factors has an impact on the risk of complications. Patients furthermore rated the benefits of treatment higher than did their physicians (P<0.001). Of the patients_ 14% had blood pressures < or = 140/90 mmHg. Most of the patients (61%) were not aware of their target blood pressure. However_ when the target pressure was communicated to patients by the physician_ patients remembered it accurately. The patients were generally not willing to trade even minor side effects from antihypertensive therapy for benefits of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high degree of inconsistency between patients' and physicians' estimations of risks of hypertension. Patients estimated the effects of treatment to be more beneficial than did their physicians.","Patients' and physicians' assessment of risks associated with hypertension and benefits from treatment."

As a result_ the moisture content in the stored wood-logs varies compared to the freshly-cut wood and it must also be noted that the moisture content of freshly cut wood differs from one log to another. Apart from storage time period of wood-logs_ the environmental factors such as temperature_ rain_ snow and sun also contributes to the variation in the moisture content of the wood-logs. This variation of the moisture content changes the dielectric constant of the wood and hence_ influences the characteristics of the RFID antenna.

By entrapping components in small semipermeable capsules_ aconvenient flow system was fabricated allowing on-line measurements of maltose. Quantification of maltose concentration was achievable in the mM-range without need for regeneration.High specificty for maltose was exhibited in crude food-samples with quantification in accordance with batch analysis.Furthermore_ a monoclonal antibody was developed for potential use as a glucose immunosensor for diabetes. Its ability to interact with glucose was determined by competitive weak affinity chromatography (WAC) to approximately 19 mM in dissociation constant. This antibody was developed to bind monosaccharides_ especially glucose_ by utilizing crossreation with a carbohydrate dextran polymer. Selectivity for glucose was greater than for the similar monosaccharides_ mannose and galactose. This antibody_ or a fragment_ in a fluorescence platform is an alternative to monitor glucose in vivo where other glucose-binders might fail.","Development of Flourescence-based Immunosensors for Continous Carbohydrate Monotoring"
"oai_DiVA_org_hik45_7","Att känna igen en motståndare är viktigt i många sammanhang_ inte minst i kroppens immunförsvar som är utvecklat för att angripa främmande ämnen i kroppen. Antikroppen spelar en central roll i immunförsvaret där den lär sig att känna igen sin motståndare (antigen) och därmed binda sitt antigen. De antikroppsproducerande cellerna kan användas i laboratoriet för att producera antikroppar som härstammar från försöksdjur. I denna avhandling har antikroppar använts som binder betydligt svagare till antigenet än vad man i de flesta analyser använder sig av för att t.ex. detektera sjukdomar. Antikroppar som binder till olika typer av socker_ däribland maltsocker (maltos) och blodsocker (glukos) har studerats. Dessa antikroppar har använts för att undersöka hur hårt de binder till sitt antigen beroende på temperatur och om antikropparna kan känna igen liknande motståndare (korsreaktivitet). Fördelen med dessa svaga bindningar är att antikroppen snabbt kan binda in och släppa sitt antigen istället för att nästan permanent sitta på sitt antigen_ som vid starka bindningar. Bindningens styrka (affinitet) har i avhandlingen studerats med hjälp av fluorescensteknik och affinitets-separation. Den maltosbindande antikroppen har använts tillsammans med fluorescensteknik för att designa två olika biosensorer (immunosensorer). Immunosensorerna kan mäta förändringen av maltoskoncentration över tid_ vilket är attraktivt i t.ex. livsmedelsindustrin när man vill mäta maltoshalten kontinuerligt under tillverkningen. Den glukosbindande antikroppen har använts i affinitets-separation för att bestämma dess affinitet mot glukos och olika polymerer av glukos. En glukosbindande antikropp är åtråvärt för att t.ex. kontinuerligt mäta koncentrationen av blodsocker genom huden hos diabetiker och därmed minska antalet blodprover man idag behöver ta.","Development of Flourescence-based Immunosensors for Continous Carbohydrate Monotoring"

Weather conditions can affect birds’ vital rates directly through increased mortality due to impaired conditions_ or indirectly via changes in body condition and/or behaviour. Most understanding of direct and indirect effects of weather comes from studies of breeding birds_ whereas the situation in non-breeding periods is less clear. Here_ we analysed annual survival of non-breeding Mallard Anas platyrhynchos_ the most hunted waterfowl species in Europe_ and assessed whether survival is related directly to winter harshness and/or indirectly via changes in winter recovery distributions. Recovery data on Mallards_ initially marked in southeast Sweden_ were analysed with an information-theoretic approach using program mark. Over 10 000 Mallards were marked in two time periods_ 1964–1982 and 2002–2008_ of which 13.3 and 4.7%_ respectively_ were later recovered. Mallards had lower annual survival in the early trapping period (0.58–0.63) than in the later period (0.69–0.71)_ with no clear effects of sex_ age or year. Within each study period_ winter harshness did not directly correlate with survival. However_ milder winters may have contributed indirectly to higher survival in the second period_ as winter harshness data were correlated with the distances to recovery positions for females_ and also because winter recovery areas have shifted northeast during the past decades_ possibly indicating a shortened migratory distance. Migration is costly_ and there is therefore a likely linkage between migration behaviour and survival of dabbling ducks_ in which direct as well as indirect effects of winter harshness may play a role. Other factors_ such as hunting pressure_ are also likely to have changed in the past decades_ and may also have contributed to improved survival of Mallards in northwest Europe.","Direct and indirect effects of winter harshness on the survival of Mallards Anas platyrhynchos in Northwest Europe"

Sixty male non-psychotic forensic psychiatric patients were interviewed about their FZ abuse. In order to obtain measures on their personality traits the subjects completed a number of self-report inventories. Moreover_ the subject’s psychiatric diagnoses and sentences were obtained by studying their files. These patients differed from subjects from a normal population in many personality traits_ suggesting psychiatric/psychological vulnerability. Thirty per cent of the subjects were acute FZ abusers. The frequency of previous admission to a forensic psychiatric assessment_ actual sentences of robbery_ weapons offenses_ narcotic-related offenses_ and other crimes (such as theft) among the FZ abusers deviated significantly from criminal non-FZ abusers. No differences in personality traits were_ however_ found between the groups. The FZ abusers were classified into three groups_ two of them based on the stated reasons for the abuse (“Fear reducers” and “Anxiety reducers”)_ and one containing abusers who had suddenly decided to stop the abuse (“Warning takers”). The mean T score on the Karolinska Scales of Personality socialization scale was significantly higher (p &lt; .05) for Fear reducers than it was for Anxiety reducers.

However_ it is questioned whether a peer-like relationship is the aim of development. Within a time span of about half a year_ 41 families with school leavers after 10th grade of non college-bound school track were interrogated three times_ regarding their mutual influences. Between-subject factors were the kind of educational transition (into professional training vs. to a different school track) and the existence of younger and of older siblings. According to the family members' statements_ parental influences prevailed at all time points. Both generations influenced each other for the adolescents' benefit_ especially concerning school and career. Further results indicated that greater mutuality in the parent-child relationship was more intensively pursued by the parents rather than by the adolescents.","Einflussnahmen zwischen Eltern und Jugendlichen im Übergang von der Realschule in die nächste schulische oder berufliche Ausbildung"

The novel two phase nanocomposite oxide ionic conductors_ Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC)-Y2O3 were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. The structure and morphology of the prepared electrolyte were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). XRD results showed a two phase composite consisting of yttrium oxide and samaria doped ceria and SEM results exhibited a nanostructure form of the sample. The yttrium oxide was used on the SDC as a second phase. The interface between two constituent phases and the ionic conductivities were studied with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). An electrochemical study showed high oxide ion mobility and conductivity of the Y2O3-SDC two phase nanocomposite electrolytes at a low temperature (300-600 degrees C). Maximum conductivity (about 1.0 S cm(-1)) was obtained for the optimized Y2O3-SDC composite electrolyte at 600 degrees C. It is found that the nanocomposite electrolytes show higher conductivities with the increased concentration of yttrium oxides but decreases after reaching a certain level.

Active carbon_ Norit RBXS 1_ was used as a carrier. The experimental conditions were varied as follows: temperature from 95 to 140Â°C_ space velocity of the gas mixture 1000-5000 h-1 and catalyst content 0-1%. The results showed that_ in the experimental range studied_ the temperature has no significant effect on the conversion of NOx. The conversion of NOx at low space velocity of the gas (1000 h-1) was high (approx. 90%)_ both in the presence and absence of CoTPP black. This was explained by the fact that the active carbon used as a catalyst support also has a catalytic effect on the reduction of NOx. At low space velocity this effect is sufficient to achieve high conversion of NOx in the presence of active carbon only. The conversion decreased at higher space velocity_ however. The presence of CoTPP black counteracted the negative effect of the increased space velocity. The effect of the 'macro-cycle black' on the conversion of NOx was significant at higher space velocitites.","Reduction of NOx with NH3 in presence of pyrolysed macro-cycle catalyst"

We show that_ depending on the expression for rho_ the following cases can occur: type-1) If rho does not depend on S_ then denoising via the corresponding PELS rule is equivalent to simple thresholding; and type-2) If rho depends on n(S) only_ then the equivalence to thresholding no longer holds but the PELS rule can still be implemented quite efficiently.

Twenty Norwegian subjects (40 eyes) with congenital aniridia and 9 healthy family members (18 eyes) without aniridia were examined. Clinical grade of aniridia-related keratopathy (ARK) was assessed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy_ and tear production and quality_ corneal thickness_ and sensitivity were additionally measured. The superior and inferior limbal palisades of Vogt and central cornea were examined by laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM).Results. In an aniridia patient with grade 0 ARK_ a transparent cornea and normal limbal palisade morphology were found. In grade 1 ARK_ 5 of 12 eyes had degraded palisade structures. In the remaining grade 1 eyes and in all 20 eyes with stage 2_ 3_ and 4 ARK_ palisade structures were absent by IVCM. Increasing ARK grade significantly correlated with reduced visual acuity and corneal sensitivity_ increased corneal thickness_ degree of degradation of superior and inferior palisade structures_ reduced peripheral nerves_ increased inflammatory cell invasion_ and reduced density of basal epithelial cells and central subbasal nerves. Moreover_ limbal basal epithelial cell density and central corneal subbasal nerve density were both significantly reduced in aniridia compared to healthy corneas (P = 0.002 and 0.003_ respectively).Conclusions. Progression of limbal stem cell deficiency in aniridia correlates with degradation of palisade structures_ gradual transformation of epithelial phenotype_ onset of inflammation_ and a corneal nerve deficit.

The main effects of electron irradiation on all investigated samples are found to be as follows: (i) a radiation-induced quenching of excitonic emissions in the near band gap region; (ii) an appearance of broad overlapping PL emissions within the spectral range 0.7-1.1 eV and (iii) the appearance of a PL band with a sharp no-phonon (NP) line at around 0.88 eV followed by a rich phonon assisted sideband. The 0.88 eV band is shown to originate from an internal transition of a deep defect. With increasing temperature a hot PL line can be observed at about 2-4 meV above the NP line_ originating from higher lying excited states of the defect.

We studied self-esteem and sense of coherence in a group of young adults with epilepsy and compared the results with those obtained 5 years earlier. Methods: The participants (n = 97) answered questionnaires regarding self-esteem_ sense of coherence_ and medical characteristics. Results: Self-esteem and sense of coherence both decreased during the 5-year study period. Self-esteem was correlated to epilepsy-related variables. Participants who were seizure free scored higher on sense of coherence_ but there was no association between seizure frequency and sense of coherence among participants who still experienced seizures. Conclusion: We found that there was a decline in both sense of coherence and self-esteem over time for young adults with epilepsy. Growing up with epilepsy can lead to impairment of sense of coherence. Sense of coherence does not significantly correlate with epilepsy-related factors_ but mirrors the phenomenon of epilepsy. Self-esteem is associated with such epilepsy-related factors as seizure frequency.","Self-esteem and sense of coherence in young people with uncomplicated epilepsy: A 5-year follow-up"

Put in relation with the processes of creating social policy in the EU_ where the social dialogue has a role granted to it from the EC Treaty_ the need for recognition of the freedom of association and the rights to collective bargaining and industrial action is evident. This paper aims to discuss and analyse these rights as fundamental rights within the EU legal order since at the EU level these rights can be questioned as to their legal status_ recognition and contents. We will consider the network of national_ EU and international regulations that govern these rights as well as how such regulations and other issues of importance for these rights have been treated by the ECJ. Through this analysis we will establish solid arguments in favour of considering these rights as fundamental rights in the EU legal order. The contents of these rights will also be analysed in a similar manner with the aim of arriving at a discussion of how the contents of these rights might affect the potential future development and function of the European social dialogue. The most important conclusion points out the efficient manner in which the ECJ has recognised the right to strike as a fundamental right whilst at the same time diminishing the contents of this right. This in turn means that the asymmetry of power between management and labour is retained in the sense that the development of the European social dialogue will remain at the discretion of the employers. In order to come to terms with this asymmetry of power different solutions are available_ such as establishing a duty to negotiate as part of the right to collective bargaining or filling the right to strike with a proper and effective contents. If this is not done the only means for pressuring the employers to negotiate binding agreements will remain the shadow of law_ which currently shines of absence from the EU legislative scene.","Fundamentalisationof industrial rights in the EU – an intricate network of legal sources and interpretations"

Little is known about how men experience bodily alterations in everyday life through the course of the prostate cancer and treatment. The aim of this study was to show how men with prostate cancer experience bodily changes and how these alterations influence daily life. Method: The study was conducted via qualitative interviews with a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. We interviewed ten men (aged 58-83) with prostate cancer who received endocrine therapy as the primary treatment method. Results: The results showed that five themes were important for the men’s experiences of their bodily alterations throughout the course of the illness: "something is ’wrong’"_ "when the body becomes troublesome"_ "to be well or to be ill"_ "dealing with the alterations" and "to talk about cancer and the intimate details" Initially_ the shock of receiving a cancer diagnosis and the physical changes in their bodies were at the forefront of many patients’ minds. Eventually_ the impact of the side effects became more evident_ which caused problems in everyday life. Yet_ the men were able to reflect on the impact of treatment on their everyday lives. Conclusion: This study showed that hormone treatment has a significant influence_ both directly and indirectly_ on the bodies of prostate cancer patients.

A qualitative descriptive approach was used and interviews were conducted with 12 occupational therapists working in community and county council care. Qualitative content analysis was used and revealed three main themes: 1) “To make the invisible visible”_ 2) “To collaborate- a prerequisite for success” and 3) “Dilemmas to handle”. The findings showed a complex scenario where the occupational therapists worked to make the cognitive impairments visible to themselves_ the clients_ and persons close to the client. Collaboration was perceived as a key factor. The dilemmas concerned different aspects in the rehabilitation process_ which affected the occupational therapists’ work with the clients. Identified areas in need of improvement are prioritisations and additional education regarding both intervention methods and theory. A reluctance to use standardised assessments was expressed and research that identifies and overcomes those hindrances in clinical practice is needed.

The aim of this thesis is to examine the long-term development of the area.Terms for base-level surfaces in the area are defined. A combination of GIS-analyses of digital elevation models and field work is used to explore landform characteristics and formation. Inselbergs east of the northern Scandes in northern Sweden are used as a basis for describing landscape development.In total_ 794 inselbergs are identified in the study area. The inselbergs are classified according to their degree of glacial erosion. The Parkajoki area_ with low glacially modified inselbergs_ tors_ boulder fields and saprolites_ has been shown to have largely escaped Quaternary glacial erosion and is taken as a type area to describe the late-Neogene landscape development prior to glaciation. The removal of Neogene saprolite mantles at the inselberg feet in areas of glacial erosion increased inselberg relief during the Quaternary by 10-20 m. For landscape evolution further back in time_ beyond the Neogene_ the hypsography of the study areas shows at least two palaeosurface generations in the northern Scandes and at least four palaeosurface generations on the inselberg plains. The distribution of inselbergs in relation to palaeosurface generations in the same elevation intervals suggests land uplift with a tilt towards the SE-ESE. Eocene marine diatom findings at 260 m a.s.l. in Finland_ 200 km east of the study area_ indicate a pre-Eocene age of the inselberg plains above this elevation.The development of today’s inselberg plains likely started in the late Mesozoic_ with a sub-Mesozic etch surface that was subjected to land uplift at the late Mesozoic-Paleocene transition during breakup of the Atlantic. The great antiquity of the northern Swedish bedrock landscape stands as an analogy for shield areas in for example Australia and Africa.","Cenozoic landscape evolution in northern Sweden"

"oai_DiVA_org_su88289_7","Microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) is a miniaturized_ solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique that works online with gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC). Not only is the automation process with MEPS advantageous_ but the much smaller volumes of the samples_ solvents and dead space in the system also provide other significant advantages such as the speed and the simplicity of the sample preparation process. In this study MEPS has been evaluated for quantification of sensory neuron-specific receptors agonist (BAM8-22). Owing to the instability of BAMs_ the focus was on fast extraction and determination of the peptide online using LC-MS/MS. Sorbents such as C2_ C8 and ENV+ (hydroxylated polystyrenedivinylbenzene copolymer) were investigated in the present study. MEPS-C8 gave the best results compared with C2 and ENV and it was used for the method validation. The calibration curve was obtained within the concentration range of 20.03045nmol/L in plasma. The regression correlation coefficients for plasma samples were 0.99 for all runs (n=6). The between-batch accuracy and precision for BAM8-22 ranged from 13 to 2.0% and from 4.0 to 14%_ respectively.

"oai_DiVA_org_umu14826_7","Former male young athletes partially lost benefits in BMD (g/cm2) with cessation of exercise_ but_ despite this_ had a higher BMD 4 years after cessation of career than a control group. A higher BMD might contribute to the lower incidence of fragility fractures found in former older athletes &gt; or =60 years of age compared with a control group. INTRODUCTION: Physical activity increases peak bone mass and may prevent osteoporosis if a residual high BMD is retained into old age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BMD was measured by DXA in 97 male young athletes 21.0 +/- 4.5 years of age (SD) and 48 controls 22.4 +/- 6.3 years of age_ with measurements repeated 5 years later_ when 55 of the athletes had retired from sports. In a second_ older cohort_ fracture incidence was recorded in 400 former older athletes and 800 controls &gt; or =60 years of age. RESULTS: At baseline_ the young athletes had higher BMD than controls in total body (mean difference_ 0.08 g/cm2)_ spine (mean difference_ 0.10 g/cm2)_ femoral neck (mean difference_ 0.13 g/cm2)_ and arms (mean difference_ 0.05 g/cm2; all p &lt; 0.001). During the follow-up period_ the young athletes who retired lost more BMD than the still active athletes at the femoral neck (mean difference_ 0.07 g/cm2; p = 0.001) and gained less BMD at the total body (mean difference_ 0.03 g/cm2; p = 0.004). Nevertheless_ BMD was still higher in the retired young athletes (mean difference_ 0.06-0.08 g/cm2) than in the controls in the total body_ femoral neck_ and arms (all p &lt; 0.05). In the older cohort_ there were fewer former athletes &gt; or =60 of age than controls with fragility fractures (2.0% versus 4.2%; p &lt; 0.05) and distal radius fractures (0.75% versus 2.5%; p &lt; 0.05).

"oai_DiVA_org_umu23080_7","Accurate measurements of the electrical resistance as a function of temperature and pressure are reported for Sn_ Zr_ dhcp La_ and V. These measurements cover a temperature region around room temperature and pressures up to 1.3 GPa. From these data_ including also our previous measurements for Al and published results for Pb_ the pressure dependence of d ρ / dT (the resistivity-temperature derivative) is obtained. This quantity is found to be a significant factor in the pressure dependence of the electron-phonon interaction parameter λ. For the nontransition metals the relative pressure dependence of d ρ / dT is much larger than the compressibility. Therefore the pressure dependence of the superconducting Tc is quantitatively well accounted for by the resistance data for these metals. For the transition metals the pressure dependence of d ρ / dT is relatively smaller and Tc(p) calculated from the resistance data is_ at the best_ only qualitatively correct. These differences are discussed. Estimates for the pressure dependence of the plasma frequency are obtained.","The pressure dependence of of the electron-phonon interaction and the normal state resistivity"

Our results showed that internalizing problems in peer aggressors could be understood as problems with low self-esteem_ while internalizing problems in peer victims could be understood both as problems with low selfesteem and as an effect of being victimized. Externalizing problems in peer aggressors and peer aggressor–victims could be understood as problems with being involved in peer aggression_ while the same problems in peer victims could be understood as problems with low self-esteem.

"oai_DiVA_org_umu41223_7","In this paper we suggest that joint facilities are an important but often neglected part in the process of creating local social capital in the Swedish countryside. Generally_ countryside households are property owners and thus also engaged in some management association for joint facilities. To some extent_ the associations hence have a similar function as a very small municipality although with only one or a narrow set of tasks. The possibility to negotiate in case of conflicting interest is more limited_ a fact that is often a source of "irritation" in the associations. Instead the social control of utilisation_ the possibility for close interaction_ and the simplicity in information sharing give the small unit an advantage compared with a municipality. In  this respect_ the associations has more resemblances to ordinary private self-managed clubs or cooperatives_ even if membership is not personal but linked with entry and exit from a specific set of propety market.We observe that management of such facilities is a part of a learning process related to institutional culture_ conflict resolution_ and a common management for creation of built assets. The associations create and maintain tangible but equally important asset in the form of social capital. The associations for management of joint facilities may thus be part of of a policy for wealth creation and diversity in tjhe provision of local public andclub goods in the countryside.We also observe that when social capital in esrtimations of local growth is instrumentalised by memberships in choirs_ sport associations_ local folklore societies etc._ it may be the case that membership in joint facilities_ often an omitted variable_ play an equally important role for the local growth through their role as arenas for collective action_ learmning and conflict resolution.","Joint facilities and the creation of social capital in the Swedish countryside"

METHODS: A total of 104 pediatric patients (aged 0.36-16.3 years) were genotyped for 17 putatively functionally significant sequence variations in the ABCB1_ SLCO1B1_ ABCC2_ CYP3A4_ CYP3A5_ and NR1I2 genes. The patients had undergone a pharmacokinetic study with intravenous and oral ciclosporine (INN_ cyclosporin) before renal transplantation. RESULTS: In the whole population_ the mean+/-SD cyclosporine oral bioavailability was 0.38+/-0.09_ volume of distribution was 2.3+/-0.54 l/kg_ and systemic clearance normalized by allometric body weight was 0.88+/-0.16 l/h/kg3/4. The prehepatic extraction ratio was 0.51+/-0.13_ and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.24+/-0.04_ the former explaining 95% of the variability in oral bioavailability (P&lt;0.0001). In children older than 8 years_ the pre-hepatic extraction was 0.64+/-0.09 in those with the ABCB1 c.2677GG genotype_ 0.52+/-0.11 in those with the c.2677GT genotype_ and 0.41+/-0.03 in those with the c.2677TT genotype (P=0.021_ r2=0.334)_ leading to corresponding differences in oral bioavailability (0.28+/-0.07_ 0.36+/-0.07_ and 0.44+/-0.04_ respectively; P=0.012_ r2=0.372). Similar associations were observed with the ABCB1 c.1236C&gt;T variant and the related haplotype c.1199G-c.1236C-c.2677G-c.3435C (P&lt;0.05). The estimated oral dose requirement and clearance of cyclosporine remained largely unexplained by the genetic variations. CONCLUSIONS: Although these data suggest an age-related effect of ABCB1 polymorphism on oral bioavailability_ further studies are required on the predictive value of genotyping for individualization of cyclosporine dosing in children.","Pharmacogenetics of cyclosporine in children suggests an age-dependent influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms"

Numerical simulations of these models help in understanding and predicting the outcome of chemical reactions.In this thesis_ several numerical algorithms for evolving the Schrödinger equation with an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian are studied and their performance is compared for the example of a pump-probe and an interference experiment for the rubidium diatom. For the important application of interaction dynamics between a molecule and a time-dependent field_ an efficient fourth order Magnus-Lanczos propagator is derived. Error growth in the equation is analyzed by means of a posteriori error estimation theory and the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian is exploited to yield a low-cost global error estimate for numerical time evolution. Based on this theory_ an h_p-adaptive Magnus-Lanczos propagator is developed that is capable to control the global error. Numerical experiments for various model systems (including a three dimensional model and a dissociative configuration) show that the error estimate is effective and the number of time steps needed to meet a certain accuracy is reduced due to adaptivity.Moreover_ the thesis proposes an efficient numerical optimization framework for the design of femtosecond laser pulses with the aim of manipulating chemical reactions. This task can be formulated as an optimal control problem with the electric field of the laser being the control variable. In the algorithm described here_ the electric field is Fourier transformed and it is optimized over the Fourier coefficients. Then_ the frequency band is narrowed which facilitates the application of a quasi-Newton method. Furthermore_ the restrictions on the frequency band make sure that the optimized pulse can be realized by the experimental equipment. A numerical comparison shows that the new method can outperform the Krotov method_ which is a standard scheme in this field.","Numerical methods for quantum molecular dynamics"

Repeated daily administration of morphine (10 mg/kg_ i.p.) resulted in drug dependence in rats on the 6th day and onwards. The BBB permeability to Evans blue albumin (EBA) and radioiodine ([131])Iodine did not alter during morphine dependence up to the 12th day. On the other hand_ spontaneous withdrawal of morphine on day 1 resulted in profound stress symptoms and breakdown of the BBB to protein tracers in several brain regions. This increase in BBB to protein tracers was most pronounced on the 2nd day of morphine withdrawal. These rats also exhibited marked brain edema and abnormal neuronal and glial cell responses. Pretreatment with an antioxidant H-290/51 markedly attenuated the BBB dysfunction_ brain edema formation and brain pathology during morphine withdrawal phases.

In total_ 12 labelled acrylamide derivatives were radiolabelled and obtained in 24–61% decay-corrected radiochemical yield (from [11C]carbon monoxide). Starting from 5.6 GBq [11C]carbon monoxide_ 0.85 GBq of formulated N-[4-(3-bromo-phenylamino)-quinazolin-6-yl]-acryl[11C]amide [11C]12da was obtained within 47 min from end of bombardment (specific activity of 60 GBq µmol−1). This strategy is an example of how [11C]carbon monoxide can be utilised in the labelling of libraries of drug candidates and positron emission tomography tracers for in vitro and in vivo testing.","Combinatorial synthesis of labelled drugs and PET tracers"

To examine the distribution of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) in human extraocular muscles (EOMs) and to correlate the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and the MyBP-C composition of the fibers.METHODS. Samples from 17 EOMs_ 3 levator palpebrae ( LP)_ and 6 limb muscles were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and immunoblot or processed for immunocytochemistry with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MyBP-C-fast_ MyBP-C-slow_ MyHCIIa_ MyHCI_ MyHCsto_ MyHC alpha-cardiac_ and MyHCemb.RESULTS. In the limb muscle samples_ fast fibers were labeled with anti-MyBP-C-fast and anti-MyBP-C-slow_ whereas the slow fibers were immunostained with anti-MyBP-C-slow only_ in accordance with previous studies. In 11 EOM samples MyBPC-fast was not detected_ and weak staining with anti-MyBP-Cfast was seen only in a few fibers in the proximal part of 2 muscles. The mAb against MyBP-C-slow labeled all fibers_ but fibers containing MyHCI were generally more strongly stained. In the levator palpebrae_ immunostaining with anti-MyBP-C-fast was present in some fibers labeled with anti-MyHCIIa and/ or anti-MyHCeom. MyBP-C-fast and -intermediate were not detected biochemically in the EOMs.CONCLUSIONS. The lack of MyBP-C-fast and intermediate is an additional feature of the human EOM allotype. The true EOMs have a unique myofibrillar protein isoform composition reflecting their special structural and functional properties.

Among the most important mechanisms is the reinforcement corrosion induced by deleterious substances reaching the embedded reinforcement bars. The external sources of deleterious materials may_ for example_ be deicing salts_ sea water_ and carbon dioxide. Research has sought to determine threshold values_ in terms of concentration of deleterious substances in concrete_ at which reinforcement corrosion will be induced_ that is_ at which concentration the passive condition close to the reinforcement turns to an aggressive state. To predict when this threshold value is reached_ the flow properties of the pollutant in concrete must be known. Some of the most important phenomena governing the movement of pollutants in concrete are diffusion of substances in the pore water_ adsorption (and desorption) of pollutants onto the pore walls_ and hydrodynamic dispersion and convection of substances due to flow of the pore water. Here a set of equations will be presented based on mass and energy balance. These coupled equations cope with the above-mentioned phenomena. The migration of ions due to an electric potential is not considered as only the initiation stage of corrosion is of interest. The constituents considered in the model are a solute @c (e.g._ chlorides)_ the pore water @a_ and the solid phase s of the concrete_ which is restricted to be nondeformable. The governed equation system is solved using the Petrov-Galerkin scheme and finite elements (compare references 1 and 2).

Its signal pathways involve integrins_ cytoskeleton_ membrane receptors_ and ion channels_ some of which are organized in cholesterol-rich_ membrane domains such as lipid rafts or caveolae. This study tested the role of rafts/caveolae in stretch-induced vascular growth by manipulation of membrane cholesterol contents. Methods and Results— Growth and protein synthesis were induced by mechanical stretch of rat portal veins in vitro. Sucrose gradient centrifugation showed stretch-induced tyrosine phosphorylation primarily in fractions containing caveolin-1. Disruption of membrane caveolae with use of methyl-ß-cyclodextrin (mßcd) reduced weight gain_ protein synthesis_ and DNA synthesis to levels in unstretched_ control veins. These effects were partially reversed by restoration of cellular cholesterol contents. Inhibited growth was associated with abolished activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in response to stretch and endothelin-1 (ET-1) but not to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ET-1 type A (ETA) receptors by RF139317 or endothelin-converting enzyme by phosphoramidone abolished stretch-induced ERK1/2 activation_ which was_ however_ unaffected by removal of the endothelium. Conclusions— Stretch-induced growth signaling in vascular smooth muscle depends on cholesterol-rich_ membrane microdomains by a mechanism involving ETA receptors that respond to endogenous ET-1 production.","Cholesterol Dependence of Vascular ERK1/2 Activation and Growth in Response to Stretch.

Questionnaire-based survey distributed to GPs in 24 randomly selected primary care centres in the Region of Skåne in southern Sweden. Subjects. A total of 109 GPs received a self-administered questionnaire and 90 of them responded. Main outcome measures. Use of risk assessment programmes. Reasons to postpone or abstain from pharmacological treatment for the management of hypertension. Results. Reported managing of high blood pressure (BP) varied. In all_ 53% (95% CI 42-64%) of the GPs used risk assessment programmes and nine out of 10 acknowledged blood pressure target levels. Only one in 10 did not inform the patients about these levels. The range for immediate initiating pharmacological treatment was a systolic BP 140-220 (median 170) mmHg and diastolic BP 90-110 (median 100) mmHg. One-third (32%; 95% CI 22-42%) of the GPs postponed or abstained from pharmacological treatment of hypertension due to a patient&#39;s advanced age. No statistically significant associations were observed between GPs&#39; gender_ professional experience (i.e. in terms of specialist family medicine and by number of years in practice)_ and specific reasons to postpone or abstain from pharmacological treatment of hypertension.

In the first paper_ the structure of Sb0.92V0.92O4 was determined by thermogravimetry_ X-ray microanalysis_ X-ray powder diffraction_ and neutron powder diffraction. Sb0.92V0.92O4 was found to have a defective rutile structure involving cation vacancies. In the second_ third_ and fourth papers_ the initial rates and selectivities of these catalysts were determined when used in the ammoxidation of propane and propene_ respectively. The main products obtained in propane ammoxidation were acrylonitrile_ acetonitrile_ carbon oxides and propene. Two synergy effects were revealed; catalysts rich in vanadium showed a maximum in total reaction rate and catalysts rich in antimony a maximum in selectivity to acrylonitrile formation. The main products obtained in propene ammoxidation were acrylonitrile_ acetonitrile_ carbon oxides and acrolein. The catalysts were characterised by XRD_ XPS_ FTIR_ and FT-Raman measurements before and after their use in propane and propene ammoxidation_ respectively. In the course of ammoxidation_ catalysts with an excess of alpha-Sb2O4 were found to be enriched at the surface with antimony_ creating a surface that was selective for nitrile formation. This enrichment appeared to be caused by the migration of antimony from alpha-Sb2O4 to the surface of Sb0.92V0.92O4. No evidence that antimony migrates from the bulk of Sb0.92V0.92O4 up to the surface of it was obtained. The fifth and sixth papers concerned the transient response method. Differential equations describing the consumption of reactants and the formation of products were solved numerically for a step change from inert to reactant feed. Different types of propene/propane oxidation/ammoxidation mechanisms were considered. In comparing the experimental and the simulated responses_ it was found that the adsorption of propane was rate limiting for its consumption in the ammoxidation of it. However_ the propene/acrylonitrile product ratio was governed by the step in which water desorbs. These results were not contradicted by the results reported in paper four_ in which dependencies of the rate on the partial pressure of the reactants was investigated under steady-state conditions.","A Study of Propane and Propene Ammoxidation over Antimony-Vanadium-Oxide Catalysts at Steady-State and Transient Conditions"

The objective of hyperthermia treatment is to raise the temperature in tumors to therapeutic levels_ for a sufficient period of time_ in order to achieve cell death or render the cells more sensitive to ionizing radiation and/or chemotherapy. One of the challenges in hyperthermia is to adequately heat deep-seated tumors while preventing surrounding healthy tissue from undesired heating and damage. In this thesis_ a new focusing technique_ based on a time-reversal (TR) approach_ for microwave hyperthermia is described and evaluated. First_ the method was tested numerically using 2-D computer models of breast and neck. The obtained results were encouraging and suggest a multifrequency approach_ in which the choice of frequency depends on the treated area size as well as on the tumor volume. Building on these results_ a specific broadband antenna array was designed. In this design the applicator is immersed in a matching liquid and consists of between 12 and 16 identical triangular patch elements placed in a ring antenna arrangement. Next_ we built a TR-hyperthermia amplifier system that operates in both continuous and pulsed wave regimes. The accuracy of the signal delivery as prescribed by the treatment planning tool is similar to clinical standards. However_ at present_ the output power allows only for experiments with phantoms or animals. The results show great promise and will be further investigated in clinical studies. Finally_ the feasibility of microwave thermal imaging as a non-invasive approach for temperature monitoring during the treatment was investigated. The initial results of this approach_ which is based on the variation of the dielectric properties with temperature_ are encouraging.

RESULTS: The AD subjects showed positive correlations between CSF-T-tau and CSF-P-tau versus CSF-Mn (r(s) = 0.22_ p = 0.004; r(s) = 0.18_ p = 0.021).

Such enumerations support efficient inference procedures_ but also the optimization of further objectives such as minimizing the number of clusters. In an extended problem version_ target graphs may have a limited number of overlaps of cliques_ measured by the number t of edges that remain when the twin vertices are merged. This problem is still in FPT_ with respect to the combined parameter k and t. The result is based on a property of twin-free graphs.

Furthermore_ we prove that all solutions with minimal edit sequences differ on a so-called full kernel with at most k^2/4+O(k) vertices_ that can be found in polynomial time. The size bound is tight.

"oai_services_scigloo_org_125823_7","In this thesis_ a simplified narrow-band approximation model is proposed to estimate fatigue damage of ship structures_ and an efficient method for extreme response predictions is also developed using upcrossing spectrums of ship responses. The proposed fatigue model includes two main parameters_ significant stress range hs and zero upcrossing frequency fz. The first parameter is assumed to be proportional to significant wave height Hs through a factor C_ derived from a linear hydrodynamic theory. The value of C depends on the mission conditions. The zero upcrossing frequency is approximated by the encountered wave frequency_ where the wave period Tz is deduced to be an explicit function of Hs. The fatigue model is validated by the “accurate” rainflow method with less than 10% of discrepancy. The uncertainties of fatigue life predictions are studied by the safety index_ employing the proposed fatigue model. It is shown that the safety index computed using the fatigue model agrees well with that computed from the measurements. With respect to the fact that ship responses are non-Gaussian_ the Laplace Moving Average (LMA) method and a transformed Gaussian approach are studied to model the non-Gaussian responses. The transformed Gaussian approach is adopted for the computation of the upcrossing spectrums. The extreme ship responses are then estimated from the upcrossing spectrums. The standard deviation_ zero upcrossing frequency_ skewness and kurtosis of responses are needed to compute the upcrossing spectrums. It is shown that the extreme responses computed by the proposed method agree well with those computed by the standard engineering method using the measured responses.","Fatigue Assessment and Extreme Response Prediction of Ship Structures"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_113676_7","New microbeam zircon dating insights on migmatites of the former Mooirivier metamorphic complex and the Neuhof formation_ Sinclair group_ Namibia Valby van Schijndel (1)_ David H. Cornell (1)_ Dirk Frei (2) 1) Department of Earth Sciences_ The University of Gothenburg_ SE40530_ Sweden 2) GEUS_ Denmark and Greenland Geological Survey_ Copenhagen_ Denmark In the 1.4-1.0 Ga Sinclair Group and its basement_ located in Namibia_ the relations and chronostatigraphic succession are not fully understood. This is certainly true for the former Mooirivier Metamorphic Complex (MMC) and the Neuhof Formation. Becker (2008) interpreted the MMC and the Neuhof Formation as part of the Kairab Formation (Hoal_ 1990)_ a heterogeneous metamorphic basement overlain by metavolcanics that are intruded by subvolcanics. This basement is part of the Namaqua Metamorphic Complex and Hoal (1990) separated the metavolcanics from the apparently older basement. The comparison Becker (2008) made was based on the fact that the units lie close to each other and lithological similarities; the MMC seems to be dominated by gneissic intrusive rocks and the Neuhof Formation consists mainly of basic volcanic and sedimentary rocks with closely related intrusives. In this study we used the NordSIM ion probe and a high resolution laser ablation ICPMS to date zircons from two migmatised samples and a red aplite dyke that cuts a migmatite from the MMC on Hauchabfontein farm. This migmatite location is interpreted by Becker (2008) as the gneissic Hauchab Granodiorite. He states that this body intrudes an amphibolite which is indicated by the presence of amphibolite xenoliths in the granodiorite. The second migmatite is located close by to the west. Our field interpretation is that the ‗gneissic granodiorite‘ is the result of a migmatisation event caused by a gabbro intrusion mixing with melted granitoid material. The two migmatite samples are hybrid rocks_ consisting of a mixture of mafic and felsic components. Zircons from these hybrid rocks showed large CLbright rims_ indicating an overall metamorphic or migmatitic event. However most of the zircons show no age difference between rim and core. These dates are 1205 ±6 and 1220 ±8 Ma and reflect the gabbro intrusion and migmatisation event. Since the cores of the zircons were probably reset_ a migmatisation event is favoured above a metamorphic one_ since it requires very high temperatures. This also applies to the formation of hybrid mixtures between felsic and mafic components. The migmatisation age is slightly older than the red aplite dyke at 1201±16 Ma. The migmatisation corresponds in age to the Barby Formation which formed during northwestward subduction prior to the ~1200 Ma Namaqua collision. In the Hauchabfontein migmatite we found one concordant zircon core dated at 1367 Ma possibly related to tonalite intrusives at 1375 Ma like the Hammerstein (Becker_ 2008) and the Aunis Tonalite (Hoal_ 1990)_ that intrude the Neuhof and Kairab Formations respectively. The second migmatite sample contains four xenocrysts with a combined concordant age of 1748 ±21 Ma. This age indicates the presence of a basement older than the Kairab Formation_ like the Elim Complex and Gaub Valley Formation to the north. South of Hachaubfontein on the border of Mooirivier Farm_ we sampled a metasediment from the Neuhof Formation. This is a low grade_ quartz-rich gneiss_ thought to be of volcanic origin. Becker (2008) interpreted fine grained quartz-feldspatic gneisses that occur in the Neuhof Fomation as intrusives because of the young age (~1320 Ma) in comparison to the 1375 Ma Hammerstein Tonalite intrusive. However in our sample we found two age domains 69 at 1330±5 and 1291±9 Ma. This indicates that the sample was not an intrusive but more likely a metasedimentary rock containing detrial zircons derived from two magmatic units. References Becker_ T._ 2008. in R. McG.

The EIA system of Pakistan appears to be less efficient in the application and review process. In addition_ the appraisal of issues_ the decision-making process and evaluation through post-monitoring is not as well performed in Pakistan as in cases of hydroelectric power plants in Sweden and Norway. The key reason for this shortcoming is misconceptions about the EIA process_ which initially receives intense attention but becomes weakened by the time of implementation. This implies that there is a need to adopt simplified and flexible EIA techniques suitable for the infrastructure and resources of a specific country_ taking into account institutional_ technical and financial constraints. Improvements are required in public participation_ awareness_ as well as in environmental control and data system sectors in Pakistan_ besides simply enacting legislation to achieve the goals of the EIA system.","Comparative analysis using EIA for developed and developing coutnries case studies of hydroelectric power plants in Pakistan_ Norway and Sweden"

Remarkable examples are strontium ruthenates whose properties are dramatically tuned by impurities and disorder. In particular_ Sr3Ru2O7 shows a strong variation in transport and magnetic properties depending on synthesis process. It is therefore crucial to correlate atomic structure and properties to identify the functionalities of individual nanostructural constituents. We report a comparative study between Sr3Ru2O7 crystals grown as single phase and in Sr3Ru2O7-Sr2RuO4 eutectics. Our analysis by transmission electron microscopy reveals that Sr3Ru2O7 domains of the eutectic have a significantly lower level of impurities compared to Sr3Ru2O7 single-phase crystals_ where intergrowths of Sr4Ru3O10 and SrRuO3 phase are seen. This is confirmed by magnetic measurements. These results identify the eutectic solidification as a fruitful way to grow highly pure crystals of polymorphic materials which_ in combination with recent technological developments allowing the extraction of embedded features of crystals_ opens a pathway for understanding of their physical properties and applications.","Toward intrinsic functionalities of bilayered ruthenate Sr3Ru2O7"

Green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) occurring in Kattegat experience seasonal hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions already today. Thus_ anthropogenic CO 2 emissions will add up to existing values and will lead to even higher pCO 2 values >200Pa (>2000μatm). To estimate the green sea urchins' potential to acclimate to acidified seawater_ we calculated an energy budget and determined the extracellular acid base status of adult S. droebachiensis exposed to moderately (102-145Pa_ 1007-1431μatm) and highly (284-385Pa_ 2800-3800μatm) elevated seawater pCO 2 for 10 and 45 days.A 45-day exposure to elevated pCO 2 resulted in a shift in energy budgets_ leading to reduced somatic and reproductive growth. Metabolic rates were not significantly affected_ but ammonium excretion increased in response to elevated pCO 2. This led to decreased O:N ratios. These findings suggest that protein metabolism is possibly enhanced under elevated pCO 2 in order to support ion homeostasis by increasing net acid extrusion. The perivisceral coelomic fluid acid-base status revealed that S. droebachiensis is able to fully (intermediate pCO 2) or partially (high pCO 2) compensate extracellular pH (pH e) changes by accumulation of bicarbonate (maximum increases 2.5mM)_ albeit at a slower rate than typically observed in other taxa (10-day duration for full pH e compensation). At intermediate pCO 2_ sea urchins were able to maintain fully compensated pH e for 45 days. Sea urchins from the higher pCO 2 treatment could be divided into two groups following medium-term acclimation: one group of experimental animals (29%) contained remnants of food in their digestive system and maintained partially compensated pH e (+2.3mM HCO 3 -)_ while the other group (71%) exhibited an empty digestive system and a severe metabolic acidosis (-0.5 pH units_ -2.4mM HCO 3 -). There was no difference in mortality between the three pCO 2 treatments.The results of this study suggest that S. droebachiensis occurring in the Kattegat might be pre-adapted to hypercapnia due to natural variability in pCO 2 in its habitat. We show for the first time that some echinoderm species can actively compensate extracellular pH. Seawater pCO 2 values of >200Pa_ which will occur in the Kattegat within this century during seasonal hypoxic events_ can possibly only be endured for a short time period of a few weeks. Increases in anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and leakages from potential sub-seabed CO 2 storage (CCS) sites thus impose a threat to the ecologically and economically important species S. droebachiensis.","Resource allocation and extracellular acid-base status in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis in response to CO2 induced seawater acidification"

The rate of adsorption has a maximum value at field strengths between 24 and 26 V/nm. It is found that by selecting sufficiently high laser energies_ or alternatively high DC fields_ it is possible to significantly reduce adsorbed quantities. Some of the physical mechanisms for hydrogen supply to the analyzed area of the tip are discussed_ and it is concluded that the dominating supply mechanism is most likely direct adsorption from the gas phase. Low hydrogen adsorption at high fields is attributed to autoionization_ and a decline at low fields is explained by reduced field adsorption.","Hydrogen analysis in APT: Methods to control adsorption and dissociation of H2"

Both processes use metaloxides as oxygen carriers to transfer oxygen between two reactor vessels: the air and fuel reactors. Although monometallic oxides (such as Mn3O4_ Fe2O3_ NiO_ and CuO) have been successfully employed as oxygen carriers_ double oxides of the general formula CuxMn3_xO4 in the CuO–Mn2O3 system are examined in this work. The carrier was produced by mixing_ extruding_ and calcining a 1:1 molar (30.8:69.2 mass ratio) mixture of CuO and Mn2O3 at 950 8C for 6 or 12 h in static air. XRD analysis revealed that spinels of the general formula CuxMn3_xO4 were formed with 0.1_x_2.5 in which x=3Cu/(Cu+Mn). The chemical-looping performance was evaluated in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor from 800–850 8C over several alternating redox cycles using CH4 as the fuel. The oxygen carrier exhibited reproducible and stable reactivity behavior for both reducing and oxidizing periods in this temperature range. This characteristic makes the system an ideal oxygen-carrier material for CLOU. Moreover_ the spinels in the CuxMn3_xO4 series are endowed with favorable physicochemical attributes (such as fast redox processes_ high crushing strength_ and demonstrated CLOU behavior) and may be viable alternatives to CuO–Cu2O and Mn2O3–Mn3O4 as potential CLOU materials.","Examining the Cu-Mn-O Spinel System as an Oxygen Carrier in Chemical Looping Combustion"

Glycoprotein G (gG) of HSV-2 elicits a type-specific antibody response and is widely used for serodiagnosis. gG is cleaved into a secreted portion (sgG-2) and a highly O-glycosylated mature portion (mgG-2). The performances of these two native immunosorbent purified antigens were compared in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format with a commercially available assay (FOCUS2) using sera from blood donors (n = 194) and individuals (n = 198) with genital ulcer disease (GUD) from Tanzania. Discordant results were resolved by Western blotting. The HSV-2 seroprevalence for blood donors was estimated as 42%_ and that for the GUD cohort was estimated as 78%. The prevalence increased significantly with age for both cohorts and was higher among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals than among HIV-negative subjects. In the GUD cohort with a high HSV-2 prevalence_ all three assays showed statistically similar performances_ with sensitivities between 97% and 99% and specificities in the range of 86% to 91%. In contrast_ among blood donors with a lower seroprevalence_ the mgG-2-based ELISA presented significantly higher specificity (97%) than the sgG-2 ELISA (89%) and FOCUS2 (74%). Overall_ the mgG-2 ELISA gave a high performance_ with negative and positive predictive values of 96% for blood donors and a negative predictive value of 95% and a positive predictive value of 97% for the GUD cohort. We conclude that native purified mgG-2 showed the highest accuracy for detection of HSV-2 in patient sera from Tanzania and is therefore suitable for seroprevalence studies as well as in clinical settings.","Mature glycoprotein g presents high performance in diagnosing herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in sera of different tanzanian cohorts."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether passive transfer of IgG and/or lymphocytes from rabbits with autoimmune cardiomyopathy is able to reproduce cardiomyopathic changes in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: SCID mice were injected intraperitoneally with IgG and/or peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from either rabbits immunized with both beta1-adrenoceptor peptide and M2-muscarinic receptor peptide (beta1+M2 group) or rabbits with adjuvant (N group). Thirty five SCID mice were divided into seven groups; N-IgG_ N-PBL_ N-IgG & PBL_ (beta1+M2)-IgG_ (beta1+M2)-PBL_ (beta1+M2)-IgG & PBL and control groups. Heart weight in three (beta1+M2) groups were significantly increased. All mice in three (beta1+M2) groups showed high titer of rabbit anti-beta1 adrenoceptor autoantibodies_ and 4 mice in the (beta1+M2)-PBL group and 3 mice in the (beta1+M2)-IgG & PBL group showed a significant increase in titer of rabbit anti-M2-muscarinic receptor autoantibodies. Focal infiltration of inflammatory cells in the myocardium was observed in the (beta1+M2)-IgG & PBL group. In the (beta1+M2)-PBL group and (beta1+M2)-IgG & PBL group_ cardiomyocyte diameters were significantly increased. Some myocytes of the (beta1+M2)-IgG & PBL group exhibited intracellular edema_ clumps of Z-band and increased numbers of mitochondria by using electron microscopy. CONCLUSION: Transfer of IgG and PBL from rabbits immunized with combined beta1 and M2 peptides was able to reproduce the early stage of cardiomyopathic changes in SCID mice.","Transfer of immune components from rabbit autoimmune cardiomyopathy into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice induces cardiomyopathic changes."

The aim of this study was to examine whether maternal exposure to cytokines or to dexamethasone (Dxm) would be followed by hormonal consequences in the offspring at adult age. Pregnant rats were injected on days 8_ 10_ and 12 of gestation with either human interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or with Dxm. Control dams were injected with vehicle. All exposed offspring developed increased body weight (P < 0.05--0.001)_ apparently due to an increase of 30--40% in adipose tissue weight (P < 0.05--0.01). Corticosterone response to stress was increased in the IL-6 group (P < 0.05-0.01). Dxm-treated male rats exhibited blunted Dexamethasone suppression test results. In male rats_ insulin sensitivity was decreased after IL-6 exposure (P < 0.01)_ whereas basal insulin was elevated in the TNF-alpha group (P < 0.01). In female rats_ plasma testosterone levels were higher in all exposed groups compared with controls (P < 0.01--0.001)_ with the exception of Dxm-exposed offspring. Males in the TNF-alpha group showed decreased locomotor activity (P < 0.05)_ and females in the IL-6 group showed increased locomotor activity (P < 0.05). These results indicate that prenatal exposure to cytokines or Dxm leads to increased fat depots in both genders. In females_ cytokine exposure was followed by a state of hyperandrogenicity. The results suggest that prenatal exposure to cytokines or Dxm can induce gender-specific programming of neuroendocrine regulation with consequences in adult life.","Prenatal cytokine exposure results in obesity and gender-specific programming."

Based on a systematic literature review_ currently available data of surveillance in wildlife and the epidemiological model_ FMD will not be sustainable in the wildlife population in Thrace although limited spread of FMDV in time and space may occur. There are several potential risk factors associated with both introduction and spread of the FMDV infection in the region. The most important of these are biosecurity_ movement of live animals and animal products_ swill feeding and access to landfill waste. The absence of significant clinical signs in sheep in particular_ and the increased levels of livestock movements associated with particular festivals in this region_ give rise to specific concerns. Active surveillance for early detection of FMDV infection in wildlife could be a useful addition to an effective passive surveillance system in domestic animals. The EFSAwbFMD model indicated that when the sampling strategy in wildlife was based on hunting alone_ the time needed to detect at least one seropositive animal for an FMDV incursion in January and July would be 39 and 13 weeks after incursion of the virus into the population respectively_ whilst_ when regular sampling was implemented over the whole year_ about one month is needed. The precise pathway for the introduction of FMDV into Bulgaria for the 2010/2011 outbreak and its subsequent spread is not known. One possible explanation based on the genetic relationships between viruses in Bulgaria is a single introduction of virus into the country from Anatolian Turkey but it is also possible that the common ancestor was introduced into Turkish Thrace and quickly moved to Bulgaria either through a single introduction or through several introductions from the same source within a relatively short time span.","Scientific Opinion on foot-and-mouth disease in Thrace"
"oai_sp1_slub_se_43562_7","Genetic effect estimates for loci detected in quantita- tive trait locus (QTL) mapping experiments depend upon two factors. First_ they are parameterizations of the genotypic values determined by the model of ge- netic effects. Second_ they are consequently also af- fected by the regression method used to estimate the genotypic values from the observed marker genotypes and phenotypes. There are two common causes for marker-genotype data to be incomplete in those ex- periments&mdash;missing marker-genotypes and within in- terval mapping. Different regression methods tend to differ in how this missing information is represented and handled. In this communication we explain why the estimates of genetic effects of QTL obtained using standard regression methods are not coherent with the model of genetic effects and indeed show intrinsic inconsistencies when there is incomplete genotype information. We then describe the interval mapping by imputations (IMI) regression method and prove that it overcomes those problems. A numerical exam- ple is used to illustrate the use of IMI and the conse- quences of using current methods of choice. IMI en- ables researchers to obtain estimates of genetic effects that are coherent with the model of genetic effects used_ despite incomplete genotype information. Fur- thermore_ because IMI allows orthogonal estimation of genetic effects_ it shows potential performance ad- vantages for being implemented in QTL mapping tools.","Coherent estimates of genetic effects with missing information"

The SacMC3R was expressed and pharmacologically characterized in HEK293 cells. The radioligand binding results show that this receptor has high affinity for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-derived peptides while it has comparable affinity for alpha- and beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)_ and slightly lower affinity for gamma-MSH when compared with the human orthologue. ACTH(1-24) has high potency in a second-messenger cAMP assay while alpha- and gamma-MSH had slightly lower potency in cells expressing the SacMC3R. We used receptor-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion to show the presence of SacMC3R in plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary and HEK293 cells but the SacMC5R was retained in intracellular compartments of these cells hindering pharmacological characterization.

METHODS: IgM anti-PC titers were measured in serum obtained within 24h of admission from 1185 ACS patients (median age 66 years_ 30% women). We evaluated major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality short--(6 months)_ intermediate--(18 months) and long--(72 months) terms. RESULTS: Low anti-PC titers were associated with MACE and all-cause mortality at all follow-up times. After adjusting for clinical variables_ plasma troponin-I_ proBNP and CRP levels_ associations remained at all times with MACE_ short and intermediate terms also with all-cause mortality. With anti-PC titers below median_ adjusted hazard ratios at 18months were for MACE 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31 to 2.44; p=0.0002) and for all-cause mortality 2.28 (95% CI: 1.32 to 3.92; p=0.003).

Material and Methods: In this retrospective study_ the records of dysphagic patients who have undergone a therapeutic videoradiographic swallowing study (TVSS) were reviewed. Forty patients without pharyngeal swallow were matched for age and gender with 40 patients with pharyngeal swallow; altogether 80 patients were included in the study. Survival was registered at 3_ 12_ and 72 months after the TVSS. Results: In this study_ the APS group had a significantly shorter survival time (P = 0.0030) compared to the WPS group when followed-up at 12 months. In the APS group_ most patients (37.5% (15/40)) died within the 3 months after TVSS. At 72 months_ 62.5% (25/40) of the patients in the APS group had died. In the WPS group_ 5% (2/40) had died within 3 months and 47.4% (19/40) after 12 months. At 72 months_ 52.5% (21/40) of the patients in the WPS group had died. Regarding nutritional and therapeutic recommendations based on TVSS_ 34/40 in the APS group were recommended no oral intake. Eighteen naso-gastric tubes were placed directly after TVSS. The therapeutic strategies recommended were head-positioning_ thermal tactile stimulation_ and tongue exercises (in 8 patients). In the WPS group_ all patients were recommended oral intake. Diet modification was recommended in 29 patients. The therapeutic strategies recommended were head-positioning_ thermal tactile stimulation_ tongue exercises_ supraglottic swallow_ and effortful swallow (in 24 patients). Conclusion: Patients unable to elicit the pharyngeal stage of swallow had a shorter survival time than patients with pharyngeal swallow_ probably due to a more severe underlying disease. Tube feeding was more frequent in the APS group. Fewer therapeutic strategies were recommended compared to the WPS group. In the WPS group_ diet modification was frequent.

Taken together_ our data provide encouraging evidence for the possibility of developing safe and efficient conditioning protocols for diseases that require only a low level of normal or gene-corrected cells for a permanent and beneficial therapeutic outcome.

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1453069_7","Autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) are found frequently in patients with autoimmune diabetes. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G(1) is the most frequent subclass among the GADA IgG subclasses. IgG(4) is a more common subclass in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) at clinical onset compared to type 1 diabetes. The aim of this work was to study the different GADA-IgG subclass profiles during a 3-year follow-up in these groups of autoimmune diabetes. Adult-onset subjects_ classified as either type 1 (n = 40) or LADA (n = 43)_ were included in the study. New samples were collected every year from these patients. In addition to conventional GADA analyses_ GADA-IgG subclasses were also analysed with a radioimmunoprecipitation assay using biotin-conjugated antibodies (directed against human IgG subclasses and IgM) and streptavidin Sepharose. During 3 years&#39; follow-up_ all the IgG subclass levels decreased in type 1 diabetes - IgG(1): P &lt; 0.001; IgG(2): P &lt; 0.001; IgG(3): P &lt; 0.001; IgG(4): P &lt; 0.05 (Friedman&#39;s&#39; test) - while levels remained stable for all four subclasses in LADA. GADA IgM_ however_ decreased in both groups (P &lt; 0.001). Patients with LADA have higher GADA IgG(3) and IgG(4) at clinical onset and seem to maintain the levels and profile of their IgG subclasses up to 3 years after clinical onset_ while all the GADA IgG subclass levels decrease in type 1 diabetic patients. This indicates a persistent different immune response in LADA compared to type 1 diabetes and further indicates the difference in pathogenesis.","The glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 immunoglobulin G subclass profile differs between adult-onset type 1 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) up to 3 years after clinical onset."

Both methanol and methoxy are formed on these surfaces after the initial methanol exposure at low temperatures. Heating to 200 K leads to further formation of methoxy. On NiAl(1 1 0) two different methoxy species are observed where the first is formed upon methanol adsorption_ and the other results from methanol decomposition during heating. The DFT calculations show that methanol and methoxy interacts with the Al atoms on both surfaces. Methanol is found to bond through the oxygen atom to the Al on-top site on Ni3Al(1 1 1) and NiAl(1 1 0) with the C-O axis tilted with respect to the surface normal. On Ni3Al(1 1 1) methoxy is situated a 2Ni+AI hollow site_ whereas on NiAl(1 1 0) the Al-Al bridge site is preferred. (C)D 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An easily applicable and removable vacuum-formed rigid dressing (ORD) has recently been introduced. We compared the ORD with a conventional rigid plaster of Paris dressing with regard to wound healing_ time to fitting of a prosthesis_ and function with the prosthesis. METHOD: Patients undergoing transtibial amputation for peripheral vascular disease were randomized at surgery to receive ORD (O) or conventional rigid dressing (C) for 5 to 7 days_ followed by compression therapy using silicone liner. The primary outcome measure was time to prosthetic fitting and secondary outcome measures included function with the prosthesis 3 months after amputation_ measured with the Locomotor Capability Index (LCI) and the Timed &quot;Up and Go&quot; (TUG) test. All patients received prostheses with a total surface-bearing socket. RESULTS: Of 27 patients randomized to one or other dressing (15 O and 12 C)_ prosthetic fitting was achieved in 23 patients (mean age 76 (43-91) years; 13 (9 men) in the O group and 10 (5 men) in the C group). Wound healing was similar in both groups. Mean time to prosthetic fitting was 37 (26-54) days in the O group and 34 (21-47) days in the C group (adjusted mean difference 3_ 95% CI: -3-9). At 3 months_ mean LCI was 28 (6-42) in the O group and 25 (2-41) in the C group (mean difference -0.1_ 95% CI: -8.5-8.2). Mean TUG was 41 (10-92) seconds and 29 (10-47) seconds_ respectively (mean difference 14_ 95% CI:-2-30). INTERPRETATION: The vacuum-formed rigid dressing appears to give results similar to those of the conventional rigid dressing regarding time to prosthetic fitting and patient&#39;s function with prosthesis.","Comparison of vacuum-formed removable rigid dressing with conventional rigid dressing after transtibial amputation: similar outcome in a randomized controlled trial involving 27 patients."

With the linguistic complementarity 14) as a general notion of complementarity_ we analyze Bohr´s views of complementarity. We find that a careful formulation of Bohr´s wave-particle complementarity_ with an explicit characterization of measurability as a particular low-level kind of quantum theoretical inferribility_ is in fact not confronted by the double-prism experiment. Much less is the outcome a challenge to Bohr´s primary view of complementarity_ namely as a tension between definability and observability in a quantum mechanical observation language. This primary view of Bohr_ which is visible already in his Como paper 1)_ is a general formulation of quantum mechanical complementarity. Although it connects well to the subsequent metamathematical development of the wider linguistic complementarity_ as a tension between describability and interpretability in a language_ it is today surprisingly seldom referred to in quantum mechanical texts. Rather_ discussions of the role of complementarity for the interpretability problem for quantum theory tend to focus on Bohr´s view of complementarity in terms of phenomena_ which he conceived in his later discussions with Einstein (and which appears less clear than Bohr´s primary view of complementarity). The hierarchical structuring of quantum theory which is suggested in our analysis of the double-prism experiment_ and in the analysis of complementarity in terms of phenomena_ is of interest also for the general interpretability problem for quantum theory_ and for questions about a quantum mechanical reality.","General complementarity and the double-prism experiment"

In this paper_ a partial modal analysis is used to examine whether internal decay in living trees can be detected by studying the resonance frequencies of the trees. We examine the resonance frequencies of living spruce of species Picea abies (Norway spruce) by means of the pulse response due to the impact of a hammer onto the surface of the trunk. The response is measured by 12 accelerometers positioned around a cross-section of the tree_ and modelled by sums of damped sinusoids. The temporal parameters are determined using Prony&#39;s method_ and the spatial parameters associated to the circumferential mode shapes are determined using the discrete Fourier transform on the set of weights yielded by Prony&#39;s method. A total of 94 living trees have been examined. It is found that the mode shapes are almost clean sinusoids_ and that reproducible results are obtained although the impact excitations are applied by hand force. The results show that a certain mode shape is found in recordings from all trees but one_ and that it possesses the lowest temporal frequency in each tree. Furthermore_ it is found that the temporal frequency of this mode shape often is lower for decayed trees than for sound trees_ and that the difference in frequency seems to be related to the extent of decay. There is_ however_ a large scatter of the sound trees_ which leads to a partial overlap of the two groups of sound and decayed trees. It is concluded that more parameters are required to further separate the groups from each other.","Modal analysis of living spruce using a combined Prony and DFT multichannel method for detection of internal decay"

Thin NaX films were grown by hydrothermal treatment using a clear solution on cordierite monoliths. Films grown by a multiple synthesis procedure were dense and uniform with a very small amount of sediments adjacent to the film_ which may be an advantage in PSA applications. The CO2 adsorption capacity and the pressure drop for the supported films were compared to those of a packed NaX bed. Although the adsorption capacity of the column filled with the structured adsorbents was 67 times lower than when the column was filled with zeolite beads_ the pressure drop was 100 times lower for the structured adsorbent. The adsorption capacity can be increased by increasing the film thickness or the cell density of the monoliths without increasing the pressure drop significantly_ indicating the potential advantage of structured adsorbents in PSA processes. Further investigations are needed in order to prove this hypothesis.","Optimization of synthesis procedures for structured PSA adsorbents"

Uterine curettage has been the most common surgical procedure performed by gynaecologists after office hours in industrialized countries_ consuming substantial health care resources. There are_ however_ risks associated with this procedure and its use has been questioned as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated early miscarriage.Aims and methods: To longitudinally assess the incidence of miscarriage and to assess risk factors for miscarriage in three birth cohorts of women (Paper I); and to evaluate and compare conservative management and surgical intervention and these methods short- and long-term effects in one observational study (Paper II) and two randomized studies (Papers III & IV).Results: (Paper I) Approximately 12% of all pregnancies ended in miscarriage in a group of women born 1962_ monitored for 20 years. One woman in four suffered a miscarriage and 75% in this group had no more than one miscarriage. No risk factor for miscarriage could be reliably identified. (Paper II) In an observational study of patients presenting for incomplete early miscarriage 83% were found to resolve spontaneously within one week_ requiring no further surgical or medical intervention. Expectant management entailed no increased risk of infection_ pain_ haemorrhage or extended sick leave_ compared to surgical evacuation. (Paper III) After administration of a single vaginal dose of misoprostol miscarriage was complete without surgical intervention within a week in 81% and within four weeks in 88% of the subjects. Expectant management alone led to an evacuated uterus within a week in 52% and_ if the woman awaited a spontaneous course of events for one month_ in 60%. The disadvantage of pharmacological management was that the women suffered more pain and that more subjects required analgesics. (Paper IV) In a randomized study no differences in fertility between surgically and expectantly managed participants were found at a 2-year follow-up. There were no differences in infant birth weights or caesarean section rates between groups and the prematurity rate was not increased in either group.Conclusions: Approximately 12% of all pregnancies ended in a miscarriage.

Department of Psychology_ University of Gothenburg_ Sweden In legal settings correct discriminations between truthful and deceptive statements are of major importance. However_ deception detection research shows that lay people_ as well as presumed lie experts working within the legal field_ rarely achieve accuracy rates above the level of chance. One reason for the low accuracy rates typically found is that differences in behaviour between truth tellers and liars are very subtle_ and that there are very few reliable cues to deception. Trying to actively elicit cues to deception (via the Strategic Use of Evidence (SUB) technique) is a new approach that aims at making differences between truth tellers and liars more salient. In the current thesis the SUE-technique is tested for the first time on children acting as mock-suspects (Study 1). In addition_ adult suspects' counterinterrogation strategies are investigated (Study 2). Stndy 1 consisted of two experiments. Experiment l focused on the elicitation of diagnostic cues to deception using two types of evidence disclosure techniques (i.e._ late evidence disclosure (SUB-technique) vs. early evidence disclosure) when interviewing children (N = 84) who were either guilty or innocent of a mock crime. The results showed that deceptive children omitted significantly more crime-related information than truth-telling children. Furthermore_ deceptive children's statements were significantly more inconsistent with the evidence than were the truth-telling children' s statements and this was more pronounced as a function of late compared to early disclosure of evidence. Experiment 2 exarnined to what extent the elicited cues helped receivers (N = 168) to assess the veracity of the children' s statements. The results showed an overall accuracy level of 59.5%_ which was significantly above the level of chance. The observers in the late disclosure condition performed better than chance whereas the observers in the early condition did not. However_ the difference between these two conditions in terms of accuracy was non-significant. Study 2 investigated guilty mock-suspects' (N = 90) counter-interrogation tactics with respect to the disclosure of possibly self-incriminating information. Specifically_ the extent to which the disclosure of this information was moderated by (a) the suspects' criminal experience (nåive vs. experienced)_ and (b) the degree of suspicion directed towards the suspects (low vs. high). The results showed that experienced (vs. naive) suspects volunteered less self-incriminating information in an initial free recall phase. When asked crime-specific questions_ experienced (vs. nåive) suspects admitted having committed less actions fitting with the crime under investigation. Furthermore_ experienced suspects' willingness to report information was not affected by the degree of suspicion_ whereas nåive suspects in the high-suspicion (vs. low-suspicion) condition were more willing to report information. This thesis presents research that deals with the active elicitation of diagnostic cues to deception by interrogating strategically with respect to the information at hand (Study l)_ and it exarnines suspects' counter-interrogation strategies (Study 2). Combining these two approaches is important in order to make deception detection assessments more reliable.

The overall time–dependence is computed by a coarse–mesh neutronic solver coupled to a coarse–mesh thermal–hydraulic solver. The meso–scale information in the thermal–hydraulic solver is provided by empirically–derived correlations_ which are strongly dependent on the flow regime. The neutronic solver makes use of homogenised and condensed macroscopic cross–sections_ which are tabulated in advance as functions of local instantaneous and history variables. The pre–computation of such macroscopic cross–sections is carried out by a neutron transport solver modelling an infinite lattice of a single fuel assembly. The entire modelling procedure involves many intertwined steps_ each step having its own set of approximations. The purpose of the present paper is to clearly highlight such steps and the corresponding approximations.","Multi-physics modelling of nuclear reactors: current practices in a nutshell"

One family member_ claudin-1_ also associates with tetraspanin CD81 as part of a receptor complex that is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver. To understand the molecular basis of claudin-1/CD81 association we previously produced and purified milligram quantities of functional_ full-length CD81_ which binds a soluble form of HCV E2 glycoprotein (sE2). Here we report the production_ purification and characterization of claudin-1. Both yeast membrane-bound and detergent-extracted_ purified claudin-1 were antigenic and recognized by specific antibodies. Analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that extraction with n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside yielded monodispersed_ dimeric pools of claudin-1 while extraction with profoldin-8 or n-decylphosphocholine yielded a dynamic mixture of claudin-1 oligomers. Neither form bound sE2 in line with literature expectations_ while further functional analysis was hampered by the finding that incorporation of claudin-1 into proteoliposomes rendered them intractable to study. Dynamic light scattering demonstrated that claudin-1 oligomers associate with CD81 in vitro in a defined molar ratio of 1:2 and that complex formation was enhanced by the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate. Attempts to assay the complex biologically were limited by our finding that claudin-1 affects the properties of proteoliposomes. We conclude that recombinant_ correctly-folded_ full-length claudin-1 can be produced in yeast membranes_ that it can be extracted in different oligomeric forms that do not bind sE2 and that a dynamic preparation can form a specific complex with CD81 in vitro in the absence of any other cellular components.

One aim of this thesis was to analyse the inflammatory response after minimally invasive surgery compared with open resection. Other aims were to investigate patient selection using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) and to investigate the outcome of TEM for rectal cancer. Methods: Inflammatory mediators were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in patients undergoing TEM_ laparoscopic or open resection. Assessments of tumours using MRI and ERUS were compared with histopathology. Registry data from TEM procedures and salvage resection for rectal cancer were analysed. Low-risk tumours were defined as tumour stage T1_ submucosal invasion Sm1-2_ <3 cm_ without adverse features_ and these were separately analysed for outcome. Results: The increases of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were less pronounced after TEM and laparoscopic resection than after open resection. The staging accuracy using MRI was increased from 0.65 to 0.83 by combining lymph node assessment using MRI with bowel wall assessment using ERUS. There were no local recurrences after TEM for low-risk tumours. Conclusions: The inflammatory response after TEM and laparoscopic resection was limited compared with open resection. The staging accuracy was increased by a combined use of MRI and ERUS. The population-based oncological outcome of TEM for low-risk tumours was excellent.","Aspects on Minimally Invasive Surgery for Rectal Tumours"

The hhGH gene was cloned and its amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA. The mature hhGH protein consists of 186 amino acids. Comparison with other flatfish species as well as a species from a different order_ the pufferfish_ reveals that the sequence similarities of the mature hhGH with that of the barfin flounder_ the Japanese flounder_ the sole and the pufferfish are 99.5_ 81.7_ 74.2_ and 65.2%_ respectively. The sequence similarities appear to correctly reflect the gross phylogenetic relationships among these telcost species. A specific GH-RIA was developed for measurements of Atlantic halibut GH levels. Assessment of plasma GH levels in adult halibut revealed large gender differences_ with GH levels frequently being an order of magnitude higher in males than females. The mean (+/-SEM) plasma GH for males kept on normal annual photoperiod were 25.2 +/- 6.11 ng ml(-1) and for females were 5.14 +/- 1.94 ng ml(-1). It appears likely that plasma growth hormone levels in Atlantic halibut can be inversely correlated to growth and metabolism. Shifting of the annual photoperiod cycles demonstrated that photoperiod in not a regulator of plasma GH levels in the Atlantic halibut. but further research is needed to assess whether GH plays a role in the reproduction of this marine teleost species.

OBJECTIVE--To examine with psychometric analysis techniques the potential for constructing valid composite variables of "The Göteborg Quality of Life Instruments". DESIGN--Prospective population study of women in 1974-75 and in 1980-81. SETTING--City of Göteborg_ Sweden. PARTICIPANTS--Representative samples of the general population of women in five age strata between 44 and 66 years of age in 1974-75_ followed 1980-81 including new cohorts of women aged 26 and 38. 1302 women were examined in 1974-75 and 1408 in 1980-81. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--"The Göteborg Quality of Life instrument"_ constructed in the early 1970s to measure symptoms and well-being in a population study of men. RESULTS--Four multi-item scales were identified with satisfactory reliability and validity_ i.e._ they met defined criteria of multi-item scales and benefit from higher reliability than single questions. The psychological symptom scale comprised all ten questions intended to reflect depression and tension_ while the physical symptom scale included all six pain questions_ the general symptoms dizziness_ breathlessness_ and nausea_ and general fatigue that belonged to both symptom scales. The social well-being scale comprises all well-being questions believed to reflect the broad concept of life satisfaction. The physical-mental wellbeing scale reflected satisfaction with both general and mental health. Several symptom and well-being questions were clearly outside the main clusters and should be treated as single items. CONCLUSIONS--Use of a few_ distinct scales instead of a number of single questions should increase statistical power because the number of comparisons is greatly reduced and problems of chance findings are thus minimized.

Clinical evaluations regarding the development of asthma_ eczema and ARC were made at 36 months of age. Moreover_ the effect of CC16 on Th2 differentiation was measured with an in vitro model for allergic T-cell sensitisation using human autologous neonatal mononuclear cells. The migration of eosinophils and neutrophils was assessed in a microplate migration system using specific ligands and receptor antagonists. We found that the levels of CC16 were significantly lower in nasal lavage fluid in children with birch-pollen-induced rhinitis compared with healthy controls both during and after the pollen season. Plasma levels of CC16 in children peaked at four months but we found no relationship between low levels of CC16 at any of the time points and the development of asthma_ eczema or ARC. However_ the CC16 serum levels were higher in children with RSV compared with healthy controls and we noted that the healthy Swedish children had significantly higher levels of CC16 in plasma compared with healthy Icelandic infants. CC16 did not inhibit cytokine production of human Th2 cells. However_ CC16 was able to inhibit Th2 differentiation induced by birch pollen allergen via the dendritic cell. CC16 did not inhibit PGD2-induced eosinophil migration but CC16 inhibited the migration of both neutrophils and eosinophils towards fMLF. To conclude_ levels of CC16 in plasma during the first years of life do not appear to be related to the development of asthma_ eczema or allergic rhinitis. Instead_ low levels of CC16 in asthmatic and allergic patients may be due to epithelial damage and the reduced re-growth of Clara cells. Reduced CC16 production may cause an increase in the allergic inflammatory response and thus lead to more severe asthma or allergy.","CC16 in allergy and allergic inflammation"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_46384_7","Mothers at increased risk of preterm birth often receive glucocorticoids (GC)_ antibiotics and tocolytics by the obstetrician but the question is whether such interventions affect the risk of brain injury and neurological outcome. We suggest that one single course of antenatal GC is the most important treatment that can be offered to patients at risk of preterm birth at 24-34 weeks of gestation to prevent brain injury. Betamethasone seems advantageous to dexamethasone and repeated courses of GC should probably be avoided. Antibiotics given to patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes reduce neonatal morbidity and decrease the risk of sonographic cerebral abnormalities even though the effect on long-term neurological outcome is uncertain. From the perspective of the immature CNS_ there is no evidence for treatment with tocolytics even though it allows transfer of the patient to a tertiary center and increases the likelihood of administration of a complete course of corticosteroids which may affect outcome.","Brain injury in preterm infants--what can the obstetrician do?"

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Risk reduction was defined as (1-HR). In patients > or = 65 years total mortality was reduced by 37% (95% CI 17% to 52%; p=0.0008)_ sudden death by 43% (95% CI 17% to 61%; p=0.0032)_ and death from worsening heart failure by 61% (95% CI 32% to 77%; p=0.0005). Hospitalisations for worsening heart failure was reduced by 36% (p=0.0006). Elderly patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV with ejection fraction < 0.25; n=425_ and patients above 75 years (n=490) showed similar risk reductions. Metoprolol CR/XL was safe and well tolerated both during initiating therapy and during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Metoprolol CR/XL was easily instituted_ safe and well tolerated in elderly patients with systolic heart failure. The data suggest that these are the patients in whom treatment will have the greatest impact as shown by number of lives saved and number of hospitalisations avoided. The time has come to overcome the barriers that physicians perceive to beta-blocker treatment_ and to provide it to the large number of elderly patients with heart failure in need of this therapy.","Efficacy_ safety and tolerability of beta-adrenergic blockade with metoprolol CR/XL in elderly patients with heart failure"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_53749_7","OBJECTIVE: Acute renal failure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Need for dialysis is an independent risk factor for early mortality after complicated cardiac surgery. Human atrial natriuretic peptide (h-ANP) is a potent endogenous natriuretic and diuretic substance. Exogenous administration of h-ANP increases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow in clinical acute renal failure. We have studied the effects of h-ANP on renal outcome in ischemic acute renal failure. DESIGN: A prospective_ double-blind_ randomized_ placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Cardiothoracic intensive care units of two tertiary care centers. PATIENTS: Sixty-one patients with normal preoperative renal function suffering from postcardiac surgical heart failure requiring significant inotropic and vasoactive support. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomized to receive a continuous infusion of either recombinant h-ANP (50 ng.kg(-1).min(-1)) or placebo when serum creatinine increased by >50% from baseline. The treatment with h-ANP/placebo continued until serum creatinine decreased below the trigger value for inclusion or the patients fulfilled predefined criteria for dialysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome variable was dialysis on or before day 21 after the start of treatment. Secondary renal outcome variables were dialysis-free survival at day 21 and creatinine clearance. Twenty-nine patients were assigned h-ANP and 30 placebo. Six (21%) patients in the h-ANP group compared with 14 (47%) in the placebo group needed dialysis before or at day 21 (hazard ratio_ 0.28; 95% confidence interval_ 0.10-0.73; p =.009). Eight (28%) patients in the h-ANP group compared with 17 (57%) in the placebo group suffered from the combined end point dialysis or death before or at day 21 (hazard ratio_ 0.35; 95% confidence interval_ 0.14-0.82; p =.017). h-ANP improved creatinine clearance in contrast to placebo (p =.040). CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of h-ANP at a rate of 50 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) enhances renal excretory function_ decreases the probability of dialysis_ and improves dialysis-free survival in early_ ischemic acute renal dysfunction after complicated cardiac surgery.","Recombinant human atrial natriuretic peptide in ischemic acute renal failure: a randomized placebo-controlled trial."

"oai_services_scigloo_org_89548_7","NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique used in protein research for comprehensive functional characterizations_ e.g. structure determination at atomic resolution. Due to the molecular size (typically>1000 atoms)_ proteinNMR spectra contain a large number of signal frequencies. Resolving these requires high-dimensional spectroscopy. However_ when the number of frequency exceeds three_ conventional approaches start to demand unrealistic long experiment time_ and the data analysis becomes challenging. In this paper we explore a combination of novel methods: Data from 5D NMR experiments are recorded as a series of 2D projections_ which are then subjected to 2D subband filters and 2D LS-ESPRIT for estimation of signal parameters. Based on the relations established between 5D NMR signals and their 2D counterparts_ projection spectroscopy allows to extract highly similar information as what would be found in conventional 5D NMR experiments; however_ while the latter would require months of experiment time_ the recording of all necessary projections can be accomplished within 1-2 days. Preliminary results show the efficiency of the method with respect to accuracy and resolution of the parameter estimates as compared with conventional methods.","Parameter Estimation of Multidimensional NMR Signals based on High-Resolution Subband Analysis of 2D NMR Projections"

The impact of different reflector designs on the mode pattern and resonance frequencies of the microcavity is numerically simulated and analyzed. This rigorous physical model is based on solving the Maxwell equations and includes such material properties as absorption_ dispersion_ fluorescence and optical gain. In certain cases_ an asymmetrical layout of the reflectors can be more preferable than the pair of reflectors located on opposite sides of the microcavity as it is implemented for typical design.","Efficiency enhancement in a microcavity solid-state dye laser with Bragg grating reflectors"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth41021_7","Zone plates are circular diffraction gratings that can provide diffraction-limited nano-focusing of x-ray radiation. When designing zone plates for X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) sources special attention has to be made concerning the high intensity of the sources. Absorption of x-rays in the zone material can lead to significant temperature increases in a single pulse and potentially destroy the zone plate. The zone plate might also be damaged as a result of temperature build up and/or temperature fluctuations on longer time scales. In this work we simulate the heat transfer in a zone plate on a substrate as it is exposed to XFEL radiation. This is done in a Finite Element Method model where each new x-ray pulse is treated as an instantaneous heat source and the temperature evolution between pulses is calculated by solving the heat equation. We use this model to simulate different zone plate and substrate designs and source parameters. Results for both the 8 keV source at LCLS and the 12.4 keV source at the European XFEL are presented. We simulate zone plates made of high Z metals such as gold_ tungsten and iridium as well as zone plates made of low Z materials such as diamond. In the case of metal zone plates we investigate the influence of substrate material by comparing silicon and diamond substrates. We also study the effect of different cooling temperatures and cooling schemes. The results give valuable indications on the temperature behavior to expect and can serve as a basis for future experimental investigations of zone plates exposed to XFEL radiation.","Computer simulation of heat transfer in zone plate optics exposed to X-ray FEL radiation"

The approach is to use the actuator for excitation of a tab that occupies the rear 25 % of a free-floating trailing edge flap. A flexible high aspect ratio wing wind tunnel model is used as a test case. Wind tunnel experiments were performed to determine frequency response functions for validation of the numerical model used for the control law design. The aeroservoelastic model is based on state-space equations of motion that accept piezoelectric voltage commands. Control laws are derived for gust alleviation with flutter and control authority constraints_ and numerical results that demonstrate a significant reduction in the structural response are presented.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth93411_7","Asymptotic analyses of the mechanical fields in front of stationary and propagating cracks are important for several reasons. For example_ they facilitate the understanding of the mechanical and physical state in front of crack tips_ and they enable prediction of crack growth. Furthermore_ efficient modelling of arbitrary crack growth by use of XFEM (extended finite element method) requires accurate knowledge of the asymptotic crack tip fields. The present study focuses on the asymptotic fields in front of a crack that propagates dynamically in rubber. Static analyses of this type of problem have been made in previous studies. In order to be able to compare the present results with these earlier studies_ the constitutive model from Knowles and Sternberg (J. Elast. 3: 67-107_ 1973) was adopted. It is assumed that viscoelastic stresses become negligible compared with the singular elastic stresses close to the crack tip. The present analysis shows that in materials with a significant hardening_ the inertia term in the equations of motion becomes negligible in the asymptotic analysis. However_ for a neoHookean type of model_ inertia comes into play and causes a maximum theoretical crack speed that equals the shear wave speed.","An asymptotic analysis of dynamic crack growth in rubber"

Our results indicate notable characteristics concerning the polaron recombination: (1) it is found that there exists a critical temperature regime_ below which an exciton is formed directly and (2) a pristine lattice is the resulting product of the recombination process_ if the temperature is higher than the critical value. Additionally_ it is found that the critical electric field regime plays the role of drastically modifying the system dynamics. These facts suggest that thermal effects in the intrachain recombination of polarons are crucial for the understanding of electroluminescence in optoelectronic devices_ such as Polymer Light Emitting Diodes.","Critical temperature and products of intrachain polaron recombination in conjugated polymers"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu13267_7","FK228 (depsipeptide) is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) that has shown therapeutical efficacy in clinical trials for malignant lymphoma. In this article_ we examined in vitro effects of FK228 on human leukemia cell lines_ NB4 and HL-60. FK228 alone (0.2–1 ng/mL) inhibited leukemia cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and induced death by apoptosis. FK228 had selective differentiating effects on two cell lines when used for 6 h before induction of granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) or in combination with RA. These effects were accompanied by a time- and dose-dependent histone H4 hyper-acetylation or histone H3 dephosphorylation and alterations in DNA binding of NF-κB in association with cell death and differentiation. Pifithrin-α (PFT)_ an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity_ protected only NB4 cells with functional p53 from FK228-induced apoptosis and did not interfere with antiproliferative activity in p53-negative HL-60 cells. In NB4 cells_ PFT inhibited p53 binding to the p21 (Waf1/Cip1) promotor and induced DNA binding of NF-κB leading to enhanced cell survival. Thus_ beneficial effects of FK228 on human promyelocytic leukemia may be exerted through the induction of differentiation or apoptosis via histone modification and selective involvement of transcription factors_ such as NF-κB and p53.","The histone deacetylase inhibitor FK228 distinctly sensitizes the human leukemia cells to retinoic acid-induced differentiation"

A distinct strain succession towards increased phage resistance and a diversification of the metabolic properties was observed. During the incubation the bacterial population diversified from a single strain_ which was sensitive to 24 tested Cellulophaga phages_ into a multistrain and multiresistant population_ where the dominant strains had lost susceptibility to up to 22 of the tested phages. By the end of the experiment the cultures reached a quasi steady state dominated by Theta S(T)-resistant and Theta S(M) + Theta S(T)-resistant strains coexisting with small populations of phage-sensitive strains sustaining both phages at densities of &gt; 10(6) plaque forming units (pfu) ml(-1). Loss of susceptibility to phage infection was associated with a reduction in the strains' ability to metabolize various carbon sources as demonstrated by BIOLOG assays. This suggested a cost of resistance in terms of reduced physiological capacity. However_ there was no direct correlation between the degree of resistance and the loss of metabolic properties_ suggesting either the occurrence of compensatory mutations in successful strains or that the cost of resistance in some strains was associated with properties not resolved by the BIOLOG assay. The study represents the first direct demonstration of phage-driven generation of functional diversity within a marine bacterial host population with significant implications for both phage susceptibility and physiological properties. We propose_ therefore_ that phage-mediated selection for resistant strains contributes significantly to the extensive microdiversity observed within specific bacterial species in marine environments.","Bacteriophages drive strain diversification in a marine Flavobacterium: implications for phage resistance and physiological properties"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu65884_7","We present an approach for optimization of assertion placement in time-constrained HW/SW modules for detection of errors due to transient and intermittent faults. During the design phases_ these assertions have to be inserted into the executable code and_ hence_ will always be executed with the corresponding code branches. As the result_ they can significantly increase execution time of a module_ in particular_ contributing to a much longer execution of the worst case_ and cause deadline misses. Assertions have different characteristics such as tightness (or "local error coverage") and execution latency. Taking into account these properties can increase efficiency of assertion checks in time-constrained embedded HW/SW modules. We have developed a design optimization framework_ which (1) identifies candidate locations for assertions_ (2) associates a candidate assertion to each location_ and (3) selects a set of assertions in terms of performance degradation and assertion tightness.

Horseradishperoxidase was used as marker for endocytosis and wasfound to accumulate unevenly in the myotubes.

The segments also contained accumulationsof acetylcholine receptors as determined by bindingof tetramethyl rhodamine-labelled c~-bungarotoxin.

"oai_DiVA_org_mdh23224_7","Drawing upon a Swedish study of vulnerable children as social actors in family law proceedings this paper explores how children themselves approach and negotiate the issue of participation. The discussion is based upon thematically structured interviews with children whose father has been violent to their mother and who have met with social workers in the context of a legal dispute about custody_ residence or contact. The analysis reconstructs how these children have dealt with encounters with social workers and to what extent they used the space for action they perceived that they had. What children are doing in this situation – that they all are somehow prepared for– can be seen as intentional at least to some extent. Therefore the concept of strategy seems appropriate: actions and non-action are chosen for a purpose. Children’s strategies are outlined and it is discussed how different child strategies may be linked to children’s perspectives on participation expressed in these interviews_ and what these links between children’s perspectives and their strategies can tell us about children’s participation in the context of a difficult life situation. One tentative conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis outlined above is that this empirical material points in the same direction as some previous studies in the field. Children in the sample tend to place less emphasis on shared decision- making and stress the right to decide “for yourself”. This tendency can perhaps be linked to the experience of previous violence and/or oppression by parents (fathers) and /or oppression by social workers. Another observation is that it is children who describe explicit or implicit protest against the ways in which the conversations with them have been carried out_ that are the children who almost exclusively draw upon the principle of participation when talking about this issue.","Children’sviews on children’s participation in family law proceedings"

"oai_DiVA_org_oru6638_7","Neisseria meningitidis_ also referred to as meningococcus_ is a Gram-negative diplococcal bacterium best known as an important cause of meningitis and septicaemia worldwide. Meningococcal disease is a rare but life-threatening illness that may progress to death despite optimal medical care including appropriate antibiotic therapy. Case fatality remains high and survivors may suffer from significant sequelae because of impaired circulation and/or damages to the central nervous system. Prevention through vaccination remains a most effective approach to control disease. The main problem_ however_ is the absence of an effective vaccine against disease caused by a broad spectrum of group B isolates.Understanding how the meningococcus can be both a common commensal and a devastating human pathogen is a major task for researchers in the area of meningococcal disease. In paper I_ we investigated and described the characteristics of fatal meningococcal isolates and compared these with non-fatal invasive meningococcal isolates. The diversity was high within the isolates from both patient groups. Group Y_ serotypes 14 and 15 and genosubtypes P1.7_16-29_35 and P1.5-1_10-4_36-2 were more common in fatal cases as were being elderly and female.The second major task in the area of meningococcal disease is to develop a group B vaccine. Six genes encoding antigens identified as promising vaccine candidates were examined in papers II &amp; III. Based on our results_ the prevalence of these genes and their sequence variation have the potential to constitute a meningococcal vaccine of broad range that also cover group B isolates in Sweden and other countries with a similar distribution of disease causing meningococci.In paper IV_ we investigated the levels of IgG antibodies in serum directed against fHbp and NadA_ two of the antigens included in papers II &amp; III. Overall_ the immune response to fHbp seems to be higher than the immune response to NadA_ with a clear rise of anti-fHbp in the young adult groups (20-29 years).","Characterisation of Neisseria meningitidis from a virulence and immunogenic perspective that includes variations in novel vaccine antigens"

The approach is based on fuzzy modeling and is using a planner for generating corresponding robot trajectories. One of the main challenges stems from the morphological differences between human and robot hand/arm structure_ which makes direct copying of human motions impossible in the general case. Thus_ the planner works in hand state space_ which is defined such that it is perception-invariant and valid for both human and robot hand. We show that this representation simplifies task reconstruction and preserves the essential parts of the task as well as the coordination between reaching and grasping motion. We also show how our approach can generalize observed trajectories based on multiple demonstrations and that the robot can match a demonstrated behavoir_ despite morphological differences. To validate our approach we use a general-purpose robot manipulator equipped with an anthropomorphic three-fingered robot hand","Programming-by-demonstration of reaching motions for robot grasping"

"oai_DiVA_org_su12765_7","Using Descriptive Translation Studies as the link between practice_ theory and training When research is carried out within the Descriptive Translation Studies paradigm_ the link between theory and practise on the one hand and between theory and training on the other is of paramount importance. The norms that studies in this paradigm seek to uncover are not prescriptive norms based on introversion by an authority or idealised notions about what translation should be about (cf. Chesterman 1997: 56). Instead_ the descriptive norms of the DTS paradigm should be based on hard and solid empirical evidence. This means that the input of DTS theories is actual translation practise itself. The researcher uncovers regularities in translated texts_ makes generalizations from them_ collaborates these with statements made by practitioners_ and on the basis of this_ descriptive norms are formulated. These_ in turn_ can be used for translator training (cf. e.g. Kovačič 1996 or Leppihalme 2000). The translators will then be taught norms that are valid in an actual workplace; norms which have evolved through the interplay between translators_ commissioners_ and readers.One example of such a study within the DTS paradigm is called Scandinavian Subtitles. This is a comparative study of the subtitling norms found in Sweden_ Denmark and Norway. The project is based on a corpus of one hundred Anglophone films and TV programmes and their Swedish_ Danish and (to a certain extent) Norwegian subtitles. The material was recorded on Scandinavian TV channels over one year and has been chosen to represent multiple genres and programme types from documentaries to reality shows_ with a main emphasis on fiction. These texts have been supplemented by metatexts_ such as books and articles written by subtitlers describing their trade (e.g. Wildblood 2002; Pollard 2002)_ proceedings from seminars with subtitlers (e.g. Mathiasson 1984; Nordisk språksekretariat 1989)_ interviews with subtitlers and policy-makers within the field of subtitling and not least with experience of the subtitling situation. In this way a sound empirical base of actual subtitling behaviour is ensured.From this material Extralinguistic Cultural References (ECRs_ cf. Pedersen: forthcoming) have been extracted. These pose a form of translation problem_ to which a number of solutions can be found in the subtitles. For instance_ if someone in the ST makes a reference to The Three Stooges_ and these are not known in the Target Culture_ the subtitler may use some interventional strategy like Specification to help the viewers access this ECR. After extracting coupled pairs (cf. Toury 1995: 81) of ECR problem + solution in the many versions_ patterns have been recognized_ which has lead to the formulation of a number of general translation solutions. These have been arranged into a taxonomy which in turn can be compared to previous taxonomies and models (e.g. Newmark 1988; Florin 1993) and complement these or even replace them_ if it turns out that contemporary practice has made them dated. Through a combination of empirical data and translation theory_ a definite set of norms on how these translation problems are solved crystallizes. A conclusion can be formulated: if you have an ECR of the x kind_ then it can be shown that it is usually solved in manner y_ under circumstances z.The norms that have thus been formulated can then be taught to prospective subtitlers who can benefit from a norm based on the experience and practice of their forerunners_ without having to amass their experience. In this way_ the theorist repays the subtitling community for helping him to formulate the norms in the first place.In this way_ translation theory provides a service to translation practice. It helps practitioners formulate the norms that they themselves use_ and helps them to pass them on to the next generation of practitioners_ keeping abreast with the development within the field. I think this is as it should be. If theory is not based on practice_ it runs the risk of alienating the very people it is supposed to help. To me_ a connection between practice_ theory and training is not only something to be desired_ it is a necessity.ReferencesChesterman_ Andrew_ 1997. Memes of Translation.

"oai_DiVA_org_su60249_7","Osmotic stress is one of the severest environmental pressures for plants_ commonly occurring under natural growing condition due to drought_ salinity_ cold and wounding. Plants sensitively respond to these stresses by activating a set of genes_ which encode proteins necessary to overcome the crises. We screened such genes from tobacco plants_ and identified a particular clone_ which encoded a 45 kDa protein kinase belonging to the plant receptor-like cytoplasmic protein kinase class-VII_ NAK (novel Arabidopsis protein kinase) group. The clone was consequently designated as NtNAK (Nicotiana tabacum AK_ accession number: DQ447159). GFP-NtNAK fusion protein was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus_ and bacterially expressed NtNAK exhibited in vitro kinase activity. Its transcripts were clearly induced upon treatments of leaves with salt_ mannitol_ low temperature and also with abscisic and jasmonic acids and ethylene. These properties indicated NtNAK to be a typical osmo-stress-responsive protein kinase. Its target protein(s) were then screened by the yeast two-hybrid system_ and one clone encoding a 32 kDa protein was identified. The protein resembled a potato stress-responsive protein CK251806_ and designated as NtCK25 (accession number: DQ448851). Bacterially expressed NtCK25 was phosphorylated by NtNAK_ and NtCK25-GFP fusion protein was exclusively localized in nucleus. The structure of NtCK25 was found to be similar to a human nuclear body protein_ SP110_ which is involved in DNA/protein binding regulation. This suggested that_ perceiving osmo-stress signal_ NtNAK phosphorylates and activates NtCK25_ which might function in regulation of nucleus function. The present study thus suggests that NtNAK/NtCK25 constitutes a novel phosphorylation pathway for osmotic-stress response in plants.","A novel protein phosphorylation pathway involved in osmotic-stress response in tobacco plants"
"oai_DiVA_org_su21934_7","Calculating a stream function as function of depth and density is proposed as a new way of analysing the thermodynamic character of the overturning circulation in the global ocean. The sign of an overturning cell in this stream function directly shows whether it is driven mechanically by large-scale wind stress_ or ''thermally'' by heat conduction and small scale mixing. It is also shown that the integral of this stream function gives the thermodynamic work performed by the fluid. The analysis is also valid for the Boussinesq equations_ although formally there is no thermodynamic work in an incompressible fluid. The proposed method is applied both to an idealized coarse-resolution three-dimensional numerical ocean model_ and to the realistic high-resolution OCCAM model. It is shown that the overturning circulation in OCCAM between 200 m and 1000 m depth is dominated by a thermally indirect cell of 24 Sv_ forced by Ekman pumping. In the densenst and deepest waters there is a thermally direct cell of 18 Sv_ which requires a forcing by around 100 GW of parameterized small-scale mixing.","Thermodynamic analysis of ocean circulation"
"oai_DiVA_org_su6744_7","On the 3rd of December 1989_ Venezuelans went to the polls for the first time to directly elect their local and regional political leaders. A process of government decentralization was initiated with direct elections of municipal mayors and regional state governors. Since 1958_ the political system had been dominated by two political parties_ the social democratic AD (Acción Democrática) and Christian democratic COPEI_ both strongly centralized parties. The system of strongly dominant political parties is often referred to as partyarchy_ with penetration of organized social and political activities. Notwithstanding_ the AD-COPEI partyarchy experienced a relatively rapid process of undermining from 1989_ losing control over important mayordomes_ governorships and municipal councils. This book deals with the transformations of the Venezuelan political party system in the context of the decentralization process. During the principal study period (1989-2004)_ non-traditional political parties like the socialist MAS (Movimiento Al Socialismo) and Causa R (Causa Radical) have emerged_ and triumphed in the elections of mayors and governors_ thus threatening the previous almost hegemonic position of AD and COPEI. The municipal_ regional and national elections of 1998 and 2000 changed the political panorama even more. Several entirely new political parties have emerged. The MVR (Movimiento V República) party of current President Hugo Chávez presents the most dramatic and rapid rise in this context. But similarly_ other parties associated with decentralization have achieved increased political influence. Theoretically_ a combination of actors’ rational choice_ and_ more process-structural approaches_ particularly the use of the framework of political opportunity structures_ helps to theoretically understand the political transformations related to decentralization and its implications for the party system. The study demonstrates that the party system and political decentralization are intimately connected and dependent of each other. This study describes and analyzes the “encounter” between the Venezuelan party system and the decentralization reform.","Suicide of the Elephants?"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu25758_7","The thesis deals with "Samfundet Nordens Frihet" ['The Association Scandinavia’s Freedom']_ its magazine with the same name_ Nordens Frihet_ and the circle that constituted the magazine’s editorial committee. Nordens Frihet was founded as a direct consequence of the outbreak of the Finnish Winter War on November 30 1939 and was a very active part of the Swedish Finland Movement. The Soviet attack on Finland was seen as a threat to Sweden and the whole of Scandinavia too_ and after the harsh peace settlement in March 1940_ Nordens Frihet made propaganda for a Nordic defence union in protection against renewed attacks from the East. When on April 9 1940 Germany attacked and occupied Denmark and Norway_ Nordens Frihet took sides wholeheartedly against the Nazi occupying power too. The magazine thereby became a dedicated anti-Nazi voice in Sweden during the Second World War.The  magazine’s editorial committee – "the circle" – is at the centre of the thesis. It was a group of ten persons that in practice formed and expressed the association's political line. The aim of the thesis is to investigate Nordens Frihet and its political standpoints during the Second World War. This is done partly by describing the association and its inner circle – the editorial committee – and partly by analysing their views.Part I of the thesis_ "Personerna" ['The Persons']_ deals with the association_ the circle and the anti-Nazi networks that Nordens Frihet was a part of. They included anti-Nazi oriented publicists and editors_ the partially similar associations "Förbundet Kämpande Demokrati" ['the Federation Struggling Democracy'] and "Tisdagsklubben" ['the Tuesday Club']_ Western-allied diplomats stationed in Stockholm and Nordic contacts. The chapter on the editorial committee shows how it became a closely united circle of lifelong friends. Their mutual relations are studied as well as their political orientation. In addition the concepts 'friendship' and 'circles' are discussed.Part II_ "Åsikterna" ['The Views']_ investigates and analyses Nordens Frihet’s political stances. Was it possible to combine the strong Nordic commitment with an equally dedicated anti-Nazi standpoint? The question was brought to a head when in the summer of 1941 Finland again went to war against the Soviet Union_ but this time side by side with Nazi Germany_ which at the same time was occupying and oppressing Denmark and Norway. Scandinavia was thus more divided than ever. In spite of this Nordens Frihet made propaganda for Nordic unity_ a Nordic defence union_ even a Nordic political union. The thesis also investigates Nordens Frihet’s attitude to the Swedish Communists_ democracy_ parliamentarism_ anti-Semitism_ neutrality_ and their understanding of being "national".Nordens Frihet was discontinued in December 1945_ but the circle kept up their contacts. When the conflicts between East and West gradually increased_ the circle harboured serious – but not implemented – plans to restart the magazine. In the climate of the Cold War they thought that Sweden would have to abandon its isolationistic neutrality and instead join a Western alliance.","Nordens Frihet"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu25758_7","Avhandlingen behandlar Samfundet Nordens Frihet_ dess tidning med samma namn_ Nordens Frihet_ samt den krets som utgjorde tidningens redaktionskommitté. Nordens Frihet bildades som en direkt följd av finska vinterkrigets utbrott den 30 november 1939_ och var en mycket aktiv del av den svenska Finlandsrörelsen. Det sovjetiska angreppet mot Finland uppfattades som ett hot även mot Sverige och hela Norden_ och efter den hårda fredsuppgörelsen i mars 1940 mellan Finland och Sovjetunionen_ propagerade Nordens Frihet för ett nordiskt försvarsförbund till skydd mot förnyade anfall från öster. När Tyskland den 9 april 1940 anföll och ockuperade Danmark och Norge_ tog Nordens Frihet klart ställning även mot den nazistiska ockupationsmakten. Tidningen blev därmed en övertygad antinazistisk röst i Sverige under andra världskriget.I centrum för avhandlingen står tidningens redaktionskommitté – "kretsen" – _ den grupp på tio personer som i praktiken utformade och uttryckte samfundets politiska linje. Avhandlingens syfte är att undersöka Nordens Frihet och dess politiska ställningstaganden under andra världskriget. Det sker dels genom att beskriva samfundet och dess inre krets – redaktionskommittén – dels genom att analysera deras åsikter.Avhandlingens Del I_ "Personerna"_ behandlar samfundet_ kretsen och de antinazistiska nätverk som Nordens Frihet var en del av. Dit hörde antinazistiskt inställda tidningsmän och redaktörer_ de delvis likartade föreningarna Förbundet Kämpande Demokrati och Tisdagsklubben_ västallierade diplomater stationerade i Stockholm samt nordiska kontakter. Kapitlet om redaktionskommittén visar hur den blev en fast sammansvetsad vänkrets som bestod livet ut. Deras inbördes relationer undersöks_ liksom politisk hemvist. Dessutom diskuteras begreppen "vänskap" och "kretsar".Del II_ "Åsikterna"_ undersöker och analyserar Nordens Frihets politiska ställningstaganden. Var det möjligt att kombinera det starka nordiska engagemanget med en lika övertygad antinazistisk ståndpunkt? Frågan ställdes på sin spets när Finland sommaren 1941 åter gick i krig mot Sovjetunionen_ den här gången sida vid sida med Nazityskland som samtidigt ockuperade och förtryckte Danmark och Norge. Norden var alltså mer splittrat än någonsin. Trots det propagerade Nordens Frihet för nordisk enhet_ nordiskt försvarsförbund_ till och med en nordisk union. Avhandlingen undersöker även Nordens Frihets inställning till de svenska kommunisterna_ demokratin_ parlamentarismen_ antisemitismen_ neutraliteten_ samt deras förståelse av att vara "nationell".Nordens Frihet upphörde i december 1945 men kretsen bibehöll kontakten. När motsättningarna mellan öst och väst så småningom ökade_ planerade kretsen 1947 en nystart av tidningen – dock ej genomförd. I det kalla krigets klimat ansåg de att Sverige måste lämna den isolationistiska neutraliteten och i stället ansluta till en västallians.","Nordens Frihet"

When signalling via the FGFR1c pathway is perturbed in b-cells of genetically modified “FRID1” mice_ they develop late-onset diabetes and_ remarkably_ exhibit the three major b-cell defects observed in human type 2 diabetics; i) Impaired glucose sensing due to perturbed b-cell expression of Glut2; ii) increased proinsulin content in b-cells due to drastically reduced production of PC1/3; the enzyme essential for the generation of mature_ biologically active insulin from its precursor form_ proinsulin;  iii) a reduced number of b-cells_ as compared with matched controls_ due to reduced ability of b-cells to divide after birth. Furthermore_ the transcription factor IPF1/PDX1_ which controls several key functional properties of b-cells and is linked to diabetes in man_ is required to maintain FGF-signalling in b-cells.

"oai_DiVA_org_umu29825_7","Given the increased heterogeneity of the transition from work to retirement_ this study aimed to analyse the associations between different reasons for retirement and psychosocial wellbeing as a pensioner. The study used data from the Swedish Panel Survey of Ageing and the Elderly (PSAE)_ a nationally representative survey of the living conditions of older people in Sweden. The results show that almost one-half of all pensioners cited health problems as a contributory reason for ceasing work. Furthermore_ those who retired for ‘push’ reasons_ such as health problems or labour market factors_ experienced lower psychosocial wellbeing than those who retired for other reasons. Moreover_ the results show that those who were able to influence the time of their retirement enjoyed better psychosocial wellbeing than those who had little or no opportunity to do so. This was true when controlling for other factors relevant to the wellbeing of pensioners. The results lend support to the argument that_ if a man's retirement is instigated because his skills are no longer required_ there will be a decidedly negative effect on his wellbeing – and that this effect is stronger than the equivalent impact on a woman's wellbeing. In relation to previous findings in this field_ the results make it clear that retirement is far from a uniform process or state.","Psychosocial wellbeing and reasons for retirement in Sweden"
"oai_DiVA_org_su85085_7","Based on Fraser’s (2003) political analysis_ I have reviewed the relations of liberal education to special education’s traditional context by comparing liberal theoretical models with the pedagogy that labours critically for a change in the basic structural terms – the structurally profound inequalities that exist. Redistribution of resources in a welfare-logic requires an “affirmative” pedagogy that emphasizes_ specifies_ and distinguishes between the needs that are to be compensated. It follows a social liberal theoretical model that acts as a “guard”_ that is_ it leads to differentiation and shapes the problem for the inclusive school. Needs for diagnostic knowledge to identify various “syndromes”_ needs that are constantly increasing_ can be seen in that light. This educational method both requires_ and strives toward differentiation. In contrast_ a “transformative” (deconstructing) educational method sees society’s basic structural injustice as time’s greatest educational problem. The latter form of educational work leads primarily to long-term thinking of a school where differentiation does not occur_ and where inclusion is the measuring-stick.","Class and Culture and the Transformative Pedagogy"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu40601_7","This paper reports on a study regarding how vertical integration is used to increase customer relations in the printing industry and illustrates the competitive consequences with vertical integration towards customers. Results show that since direct customers are perceived as more loyal and profitable than advertising agencies and/or print brokers_ integration of content creation is common to increase relations with direct customers. However_ as direct customers' part of total production is still very small_ integration of content creation gives rise to a potentially competitive situation between printing firms and advertising agencies. Printing firms recognized this problem as they try to avoid this competition. Two different approaches to the problem are illustrated. Printing firms either focus on simple jobs that are not of advertising agencies' interest or they isolate these services in a separate firm_ and consequently can compete for direct customers and still be a printing firm to advertising agencies.","Moving closer to the customers"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu12593_7","Evidence for pedicle sizes and pedicle morphologies of fossil linguliform brachiopods is scarce and mainly restricted to exceptionally preserved specimens of fossil Lagerstätten. Recently described specimens of linguloid brachiopods with preserved soft parts have shown that the traditional view of these brachiopods being infaunal and bearing a long pedicle was incorrect_ and there existed a wider range of pedicle morphologies and lifestyles. Not all linguloid brachiopods had a burrowing life style_ and epibenthic forms with either long thread-like or short and robust pedicles also existed. Despite this variety of pedicles in linguloid brachiopods_ virtually nothing is known about pedicle morphology of acrotretid brachiopods_ an extremely diverse and common group during the early Palaeozoic. Evidence from a malformed shell of the middle Cambrian Acanthatreta suggests that some acrotretids_ i.e._ the family Ceratretidae_ had a short_ pad-like pedicle that permanently attached to a hard substrate. The posterior margin of the malformed shell shows two dents symmetrically arranged adjacent to the pseudointerarea. These dents may have formed because the brachiopod larva had settled in a shallow depression on the seafloor_ which imposed lateral growth limitations on the brachiopod shell during the juvenile growth state. As these lateral limitations could not be actively compensated for by the organism_ a firm attachment with a short pedicle is assumed. This is in accordance with the funnel shaped external pedicle opening of Acanthatreta_ which tapers towards the interior of the shells and probably hosted the main part of the pedicle. This type of opening allows the pedicle to expand rapidly in diameter towards the exterior_ thereby enlarging the attachment area and facilitating a firm connection to the substrate.","Malformation and functional morphology as a clue to pedicle size and pedicle morphology of ceratretid brachiopods (Acrotretida; Linguliformea)"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu81_7","The subject of this dissertation is the confessional revivalist organisation Evangeliska Fosterlands-Stiftelsen (EFS – approximately the Swedish Evangelical Mission Society) between 1856 and 1910. EFS was founded in 1856 in a Pietistic tradition_ and its aim was to revitalise from within what was seen as a too dormant State church_ and also to counteract the influence of the emerging free churches.The study has five main sections. The introductory part consists of the theoretical framework and the historical context. In the second chapter EFS’ aims and expectations are studied on a national level. The third chapter examines the content of published and distributed tracts. The fourth chapter focuses on the activities of the itinerant colporteurs_ and the fifth and final part studies the work of a local EFS-congregation.The aim of the dissertation is twofold. The first objective is to describe the transformation EFS underwent during the period studied. This process is described in terms related to Jürgen Habermas’ expression “public sphere”. When EFS was founded_ as a board_ it can be seen as one of other middle- and upper-class associations_ and as such a part of the Swedish public sphere. By 1910 EFS had begun to move away from the Swedish State church and had become more like contemporary popular movements and free churches – it had started to take the shape of an limited alternative sphere_ a denomination.The second aim is to use EFS as an example to describe and analyse the changed perception of religion during the second half of the 19th century. This change is described as a process of secularisation. Secularisation is seen here as the process that turned religion into an individual_ voluntary and optional act of faith_ among other religious and non-religious alternatives_ for ordinary people. Of particular interest is the paradoxical relation between revivalism and secularisation. Various revivalist movements emphasised the personal relation to God and the individual right to interpret the word of God. The individual choice for salvation was also stressed within revivalism. These movements also created new alternatives to the all-embracing State church. Thus both the position of the Church_ and the universal claims of Christianity in general_ were undermined.The transformation EFS underwent is seen as an adaptation to the rise of modern society_ which became more pluralistic and hence competitive during the final decades of the 19th century. This development meant that new strategies were required for religious organisations overall_ in order for them to be able to compete and flourish.","Ett utvalt släkte"

The scale dependency was evaluated by comparing three levels of spatial resolution of patches. Prevalence data were obtained from slaughtered animals. Our models predict that the prevalence of D. dendriticum increases in grazed areas with woody vegetation_ whereas moist and wet areas decrease parasite prevalence. The predictive power of the statistical models increased with increasing level of patch resolution. Approximately 42% of the variation in parasite prevalence (angular transformation) was explained by the areal proportion of vegetation types (4th-root-transformed). Based on the results obtained_ we believe that our model strategy provides a rational and systematic tool to identify habitats that carry risk for D. dendriticum infection of ruminants_ and that it can be applied to other parasites with similar life cycles such as Fasciola hepatica.","Predicting risk habitats for the transmission of the small liver fluke_ Dicrocoelium dendriticum to grazing ruminants"

How can the all-important agenda be shaped so as to enhance the prospects of an agreement being reached? How the agenda is managed directly affects the negotiation process which follows and the eventual outcome. Yet researchers have paid little attention to the particular dynamics and challenges of agenda management in large-scale multilateral negotiations_ and actual practice points to several weaknesses. This article proposes that the complexity of the agenda in multilateral talks needs to be managed and reduced in procedurally just ways if a successful outcome (agreement) is to result. It develops an analytical framework of agenda management in multilateral negotiations and conducts a structured focused comparison to explain the differences in outcomes of two rounds of WTO negotiations: the failure of the 2003 Cancún Ministerial Conference and the success of the 2004 Geneva negotiations in reaching an agreement. The findings support the proposition that a successful outcome depends in part on reducing agenda complexity and that this needs to be achieved in procedurally acceptable (if not just) ways.","Setting the Table for Success - or Failure?"

The problem of finding optimal transmission schemes for the case when the transmitter knows the channel and the case when the transmitter does not know the channel are considered. Also considered is the case when some partial feedback is possible from the receiver to the transmitter.When the transmitter knows the channel perfectly_ a beamforming solution is shown to be optimal. To tackle the case where the transmitter does not know the channel perfectly_ schemes based on orthogonal designs are proposed that give the best performance under some conditions. A differential detection scheme is also proposed where neither the transmitter nor the receiver has to know the channel. The thesis also considers the concatenation of a conventional (scalar) coding scheme with a space-time modulation scheme and shows how optimum coded diversity can be obtained with this concatenation. An alternative to the concatenation method concatenation of a space-time modulation scheme with a scalar code is to develop space-time trellis codes.Orthogonal designs are usually associated with space-time block codes. In this thesis the design of space-time trellis codes based on orthogonal designs is considered. A turbo implementation of the new trellis codes is also proposed.","Designing Space-Time Codes Using Orthogonal Designs"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu4277_7","This thesis is a contribution to a hitherto neglected area of research: The African Pentecostal Churches_ that do not belong to those called African Indigenous Churches (AICs). It is a case study from the perspective of southern Burundi_ the periphery of the ancient kingdom.The Pentecostal Movement in Burundi was born in the encounter between Swedish Pentecostal missionaries and the population in the southern part of the country. This study highlights what happened in that encounter.The thesis consists of six parts. The first is a survey of the Pentecostal Movement in Sweden. The diachronic structure of parts two to five focuses on the development within the Burundian Pentecostal Churches and their relationship to the Burundian society 1935-1960. In the sixth part the diachronic approach is augmented by structural analyses_ showing how aspects in the Pentecostal Movement developed.The Pentecostal missionaries accepted in part the traditional world view_ the belief in a spiritual world and non-rational explanations to misfortunes in life. They encouraged the Burundians to do spiritual experiences_ and especially the baptism in the Holy Ghost. The Burundian evangelists and church elders played a decisive role. It was their task to reformulate the Pentecostal message in Kirundi_ which was not spoken by the missionaries. They moulded the message into a Burundian Pentecostal message_ at the same time respecting the teaching of the early missionaries.They succeeded in doing that so well that the Pentecostal Movement became a popular movement_ in certain places the dominating Christian denomination_ in spite of the parallel work done by the Catholic Church_ encouraged and supported by the Belgian state.This thesis builds on material taken mainly from unpublished sources from archives in Burundi_ Sweden_ Rome_ Great Britain and Denmark.

The clinical features in 6 of the children included psychomotor regression_ refractory seizures_ stroke-like episodes_ hepatopathy_ and ataxia compatible with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. Three families harbored a previously reported A467T substitution_ which was found in compound with the earlier described G848S or the W748S substitution or a novel R574W substitution. Two families harbored the W748S change in compound with either of 2 novel mutations predicted to give an R232H or M1163R substitution. Muscle morphology showed mitochondrial myopathy with cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers in 4 patients. mtDNA analyses in muscle tissue revealed mtDNA depletion in 3 of the children and mtDNA deletions in the 2 sibling pairs. Neuropathologic investigation in 3 children revealed widespread cortical degeneration with gliosis and subcortical neuronal loss_ especially in the thalamus_ whereas there were only subcortical neurodegenerative findings in another child. The results support the concept that deletions as well as depletion of mtDNA are involved in the pathogenesis of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and add 3 new POLG1 mutations associated with an early-onset neurodegenerative disease.","POLG1 mutations associated with progressive encephalopathy in childhood"

In this paper three different ways of organizing business activities are discussed and compared. The paper proposes that business networks in different economies and contexts are constituted in their own manner because of underlying logics and principles. So far little attention has been given to the fact that national environments may differ quite remarkably. Specifically_ the differences between Western and emerging markets are of such magnitude that they entail different strategic situations for the MNC_ (Jansson_ 2006). For instance_ business networks in China and Russia differ sociologically_ organizationally and economically from inter-firm networks in the west. The differences of these contextually distinctive business networks may limit the transferability of business strategies and organizational concepts between contexts. In the conceptual and comparative paper theoretical perspectives as well as practical business matters in the three settings are highlighted and analyzed. In the end core elements of the different network types are presented and compared together with implications. The paper suggests that business networks are part of and integrated in a cultural and institutional context. The business network can not be analyze nor understood in isolation from the context_ instead the business network interact with the cultural and institutional context.","Institutions and Networks"

The research is a form of praxis related enquiry_ and concerns a Swedish university level teacher training course for prospective English language teachers_ for which I am the course co-ordinator. From July 2007 all higher education degrees in Sweden_ as well as in the rest of Europe_ have to be expressed through so-called learning outcomes. The introduction of learning outcomes into higher education are a key part of the 1999 Bologna declaration_ that emphasises the need to express the knowledge_ understanding_ competences and other attributes contained within courses and their components. The course concerned was organised around student learning outcomes from the beginning of 2008. The paper outlines my own learning and understanding of the research process and learning culture; from a technical rational approach of trying to “prove” that improvements in student learning had occurred_ to a second stage of trying to open up the research process to other stakeholders and then to an understanding of why this “democratisation “ process had only a limited success. The final research stage involves a more critical understanding of the introduction of student learning outcomes when put into the context of the complexities of the local (and global) learning culture. James and Biesta describe learning cultures as the social practices through which people learn_ and the combination of the theory of learning cultures and the cultural theory of learning necessitates a different approach towards the improvement of teaching and learning_ one which focuses on changing the culture rather than on only one element of it. This involves interpreting the interplay between teaching_ teachers_ learning_ learners_ learning situations and wider historical economic social and political influences. While I have only just begun to analyse my data_ initial reflections suggest that the introduction of student learning outcomes has only had a limited influence on the local learning culture. Whilst there has been a positive influence on synergy (increasing cooperation and openness between teachers_ and also between teachers and learners ) this has had only a limited influence on practice. Other aspects of the learning culture have not been greatly improved. As far as learning opportunities are concerned ( what is allowed_ disallowed_ encouraged or discouraged in the name of learning) there still exists a culture where examinations tasks tend to encourage the transmission of factual knowledge . Students have very few opportunities to express a critical voice_ there has been only a very limited move towards increasing student levels of empowerment; with little or no flexibility for students to decide on the method and content of their studies.","Student learning outcomes and their influence on a learning culture"

Looking around we find users with mobile phones_ wireless PDAs_ pagers_ MP3 players_ and wireless headphones to connect to these devices - a small testament of the impact of wireless communications on our daily lives. In addition the burst of new technologies such as Bluetooth and other short-range wireless communications are encouraging the further development of a wide variety of distributed wireless devices. Two major impediments to high-performance digital wireless communication systems are intersymbol interference (ISI) and cochannel interference (CCI). ISI is caused by the frequency selectivity (time dispersion) of the channel due to multipath propagation. Equalizers can be used to compensate for these channel distortions. One may design an equalizer given the received signal_ or one may first estimate the channel impulse response and then design an equalizer based on the estimated channel. CCI_ on the other hand_ arises from cellular frequency reuse and thus limits the quality and capacity (number of users) of wireless networks. CCI can be reduced by the use of adaptive antenna arrays (also known as "smart antennas"). These systems utilize an array of antenna elements that provide directional (spatial) information about the received signals. Since the desired signal and unwanted cochannel interferers generally arrive from different directions_ an adaptive beamforming algorithm can adjust the spatial gain to enhance the desired signal and mitigate the cochannel interferers. In this Thesis_ we describe receiver architectures and adaptive signal processing algorithms designed to compensate for the ISI and CCI in wireless communication systems.","Combating Intersymbol Interference and Cochannel Interference in Wireless Communication Systems"

AGE and its variants has been widely used for speech enhancement applications. There are two broad categories of these variants. The first deals with its improvement in time-frequency domain with readjustment of the used parameters and the second one deals with performing the main filtering operation in modulation frequency domain. This paper evaluates the working of AGE in modulation frequency domain with the use of a demodulation technique which solves the demodulation process as a convex optimization problem. The performance of the modified AGE is compared with the traditional AGE and another modulation frequency domain AGE based on demodulation using the spectral center-of-gravity. These used performance measures are Signal to Noise Ratio Improvement(SNRI)_ Spectral Distortion(SD) and Mean Option Score(MOS).","Modulation frequency domain adaptive gain equalizer using convex optimization"

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_114703_7","C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a potent inhibitor of the classical pathway of the complement system. This large plasma glycoprotein consists of seven identical a- chains and a unique b-chain held together by disulphide bridges. Both types of subunits are composed almost exclusively of complement control protein domains (CCPs). Using homology-based computer modelling and mutagenesis of recombinant proteins we have localized binding sites for several ligands of C4BP: complement factor C4b_ heparin and vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein S (PS). We found that C4b requires CCP1–3 of the a-chain for binding. The interaction is ionic in nature and mediated by a cluster of positively charged amino acids present on the interface between CCP1 and CCP2 of the a-chain. Loss of C4b-binding resulted in a loss of all inhibitory functions of C4BP within the classical pathway of complement. Binding of heparin required CCPs 1–3 of the a-chain_ with CCP2 being the most important_ as well as the cluster of positively charged amino acids involved in binding of C4b. The interaction between C4BP and PS is of very high affinity and conveyed by a cluster of surface exposed hydrophobic amino acids localized on CCP1 of the b-chain. Furthermore_ C4BP is captured on the surface of several pathogens_ which may contribute to their serum resistance and pathogenicity. We have localized interaction of C4BP with Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ Bordetella pertussis_ Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli to various regions of the a-chain.","Structural and functional studies of complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein."

Both histologies are directly related to tobacco smoking. We wanted to define the risk of esophageal cancer by histology and length of stay among immigrants in Sweden. The nationwide Swedish Family Cancer database (2010 version: data on cancers originate from the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry) was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for esophageal cancer among immigrants compared with the native Swedes. SIRs for lung cancer were also calculated as a proxy for smoking prevalence. The patient series covered 5930 male and 1998 female Swedes_ and 410 and 198 immigrants. The risk of esophageal cancer was increased in female Finns (SIR=1.66)_ Britons (3.73)_ and Southeast Africans (5.26)_ whereas male Baltic (0.44)_ former Yugoslavian (0.47)_ other Europeans (0.58)_ and other Asians (0.52) showed a decreased risk. The risk of squamous cell carcinoma was increased among Finns (men=1.32_ women=1.90) and Iranian women (3.80)_ whereas Danish men (1.66) had an increased risk of adenocarcinoma. No trend was observed for the risks in immigrants according to the length of stay. We found no covariation between the birth region-specific SIRs for squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer. Early childhood exposures or preservation of original habits might be the main environmental exposures influencing squamous cell carcinoma risks in some immigrants. The increased risk of adenocarcinoma among Danish men may confirm the role of obesity in adenocarcinoma risk.","Esophageal cancer risk among immigrants in Sweden."

This study aims to clarify the reliability of Hb-adduct measurement from individual single samples for exposure assessment of dietary AA intake. The intra-individual variations of AA- and GA-adduct levels measured in blood samples collected over 20 months from 13 non-smokers were up to 2-fold and 4-fold_ respectively. The corresponding interindividual variations observed between 68 non-smokers_ with large differences in AA intake_ were 6-fold and 8-fold_ respectively. The intra-individual variation of the GA-to-AA-adduct level ratio was up to 3-fold_ compared to 11-fold between individuals (n = 68). From AA-adduct levels the average AA daily intake (n = 68) was calculated and compared to that estimated from dietary history methodology: 0.52 and 0.67 mu g/kg body weight and day_ respectively. At an individual level the measures showed low association (Rs = 0.39). Conclusions: Dietary AA is the dominating source to measured AA-adduct levels and corresponding inter- and intra-individual variations in non-smokers.

Despite the fact that liver metastases are a leading cause of colorectal cancer deaths_ the molecular genetic basis of the advanced disease stages remains poorly understood. We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on 17 liver metastases from colorectal carcinomas and compared the quantitative profile with the qualitative profile previously obtained with chromosome banding. An average of 12.6 aberrations per tumor was found by CGH. Chromosome 18 and chromosome arms 4q_ 8p_ and 17p were most frequently lost_ whereas chromosomes 7 and 20 and chromosome arms 6p_ 8q_ and 13q were most frequently gained. We compared the chromosome banding and CGH data after converting the karyotypes into net copy number gains and losses. Ten tumors showed agreement between the findings of the two techniques_ whereas five tumors did not (in two cases_ no mitotic cells were obtained for banding analysis). All five discordant cases had a &quot;simple&quot; abnormal or normal karyotype_ but revealed multiple changes by CGH. A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that in vitro growth before G-banding selected against the cancer cells. Interestingly_ by comparing the CGH profiles of the &quot;complex&quot; vs. the &quot;simple&quot;/normal karyotype groups_ deletion of 8p and gain of 16q were seen more frequently in the former group. The liver metastases had the same aberrations as seen in primary colorectal carcinomas_ summarized in a literature survey. However_ these aberrations were seen more frequently in liver metastases_ which may be attributable to increased genetic instability.

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_3400347_7","Prostate cancer (PCa) is dependent on androgen receptor signaling and aberrations of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway mediating excessive and sustained growth signaling. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human PCas. Oncogenic mTORC1 signaling activates key subsets of mRNAs that cooperate in distinct steps of PCa initiation and progression. Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of PCa. mTORC1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis_ lipid synthesis and autophagy pathways that couple nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer. This review provides evidence that PCa initiation and progression are promoted by cow&#39;s milk_ but not human milk_ stimulation of mTORC1 signaling. Mammalian milk is presented as an endocrine signaling system_ which activates mTORC1_ promotes cell growth and proliferation and suppresses autophagy. Naturally_ milk-mediated mTORC1 signaling is restricted only to the postnatal growth phase of mammals. However_ persistent consumption of cow&#39;s milk proteins in humans provide highly insulinotropic branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) provided by milk&#39;s fast hydrolysable whey proteins_ which elevate postprandial plasma insulin levels_ and increase hepatic IGF-1 plasma concentrations by casein-derived amino acids. BCAAs_ insulin and IGF-1 are pivotal activating signals of mTORC1. Increased cow&#39;s milk protein-mediated mTORC1 signaling along with constant exposure to commercial cow&#39;s milk estrogens derived from pregnant cows may explain the observed association between high dairy consumption and increased risk of PCa in Westernized societies. As well-balanced mTORC1-signaling plays an important role in appropriate prostate morphogenesis and differentiation_ exaggerated mTORC1-signaling by high cow&#39;s milk consumption predominantly during critical growth phases of prostate development and differentiation may exert long-term adverse effects on prostate health. Attenuation of mTORC1 signaling by contemporary Paleolithic diets and restriction of dairy protein intake_ especially during mTORC1-dependent phases of prostate development and differentiation_ may offer protection from the most common dairy-promoted cancer in men of Western societies.","The impact of cow's milk-mediated mTORC1-signaling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer"

It has been hypothesized that DED may also be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D)_ but limited evidence exists. Therefore_ we investigated the association between DED and risk of T2D in a large prospective study with heterogeneity of dietary intake. Methodology/Principal Findings: A case-cohort study was nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study of 340_234 participants contributing 3.99 million person years of follow-up_ identifying 12_403 incident diabetes cases and a random subcohort of 16_835 individuals from 8 European countries. DED was calculated as energy (kcal) from foods (except beverages) divided by the weight (gram) of foods estimated from dietary questionnaires. Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models were fitted by country. Risk estimates were pooled by random effects meta-analysis and heterogeneity was evaluated. Estimated mean (sd) DED was 1.5 (0.3) kcal/g among cases and subcohort members_ varying across countries (range 1.4-1.7 kcal/g). After adjustment for age_ sex_ smoking_ physical activity_ alcohol intake_ energy intake from beverages and misreporting of dietary intake_ no association was observed between DED and T2D (HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93-1.13)_ which was consistent across countries (l(2) = 2.9%). Conclusions/Significance: In this large European case-cohort study no association between DED of solid and semi-solid foods and risk of T2D was observed. However_ despite the fact that there currently is no conclusive evidence for an association between DED and T2DM risk_ choosing low energy dense foods should be promoted as they support current WHO recommendations to prevent chronic diseases.","The Association between Dietary Energy Density and Type 2 Diabetes in Europe: Results from the EPIC-InterAct Study"

Because of the ritual character of the inscriptions the language is rather standardized. The greatest variation is in proper names. As has long been noted the typical formula is (in English translation): N raised this stone after M his P_ where N and M are personal names and P is a kinship term. Additional sentences may state where the person died_ e.g. He fell in Greece. Depending on the success of the new religion the formula God help his soul is sometimes also added (for safety). There are about 3000 rune stones with text of this type. The purpose of this paper is to describe a computer program which is able to interpret such typical rune stone texts and translate them into Modern Swedish. In a first step the runes are transliterated into Latin letters. The second step is the parsing of the transliterated text resulting in a functionalsemantic representation showing the analysis in terms of subject_ predicate_ objects and adverbials functional roles) in addition to word meanings according to Swetra grammar. In a third step this functional representation is then used as an intermediate language (interlingua) in an automatic translation into Modern Swedish.

Visibility in the scientific community stems partly from presenting research as an invited speaker at organized meetings. We analysed the sex ratio of presenters at the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) Congress 2011_ where all abstract submissions were accepted for presentation. Women were under-represented among invited speakers at symposia (15% women) compared to all presenters (46%)_ regular oral presenters (41%) and plenary speakers (25%). At the ESEB congresses in 2001-2011_ 9-23% of invited speakers were women. This under-representation of women is partly attributable to a larger proportion of women_ than men_ declining invitations: in 2011_ 50% of women declined an invitation to speak compared to 26% of men. We expect invited speakers to be scientists from top ranked institutions or authors of recent papers in high-impact journals. Considering all invited speakers (including declined invitations)_ 23% were women. This was lower than the baseline sex ratios of early-mid career stage scientists_ but was similar to senior scientists and authors that have published in high-impact journals. High-quality science by women therefore has low exposure at international meetings_ which will constrain Evolutionary Biology from reaching its full potential.

On the contrary_ in the recent decades_ a number of yield raising crop varieties and technologies have been launched by national and international research organisations operating on the continent. Plausible reasons for the rather poor adoption of such technologies by African smallholders_ include the non-agricultural priorities made by African leaders after independence_ as well as lack of inclusion of private entrepreneurs and farmer organisation in the development process. Since the 1980s_ structural adjustment and global market liberalisation seem to have implied further obstacles to state driven agricultural intensification of the kind seen earlier in Asia.

To study trends in treatment_ health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in two cross-sectional surveys over a 5-yr period and in an observational follow-up sub-cohort based on a population-based rheumatoid arthritis (RA) register in Malm6_ Sweden. Material and methods. A continuously updated population-based RA register was established in Malm6 city in southern Sweden in 1997. Patient-administered questionnaires in 1997 and 2002 were used to collect information on demographics_ medication and health status. Cross-sectional comparisons were made between 1997 and 2002. A longitudinal analysis was also performed in the RA patients participating in both surveys. Results. Increased proportions of patients were treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (69 vs 52%)_ corticosteroids (30 vs 23%)_ methotrexate (52 vs 29%) and biologics (14 vs 0%) in 2002 compared with 1997. In the cross-sectional analysis_ the visual analogue scores (VAS) for pain and general health and the short form 36 (SF-36) domains were slightly better in 2002 than in 1997. In the observational sub-cohort_ patients treated with biologics improved significantly in several measures of health status_ whereas those starting on methotrexate or undergoing other or no changes in DMARD therapy did not. Conclusions. In this population-based RA cohort_ patients were more actively treated in 2002. Small improvements were seen in health status and these improvements were exclusively attributable to treatment with biologics.","Trends in medication and health-related quality of life in a population-based rheumatoid arthritis register in Malmo_ Sweden"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_957713_7","This paper presents a method to calculate the forces in a chain and_ thus_ the resulting load distribution along the sprockets in a chain transmission working at a moderate or high speed. When the chain drive is loaded_ the rollers that contact the sprockets will move along the flanks to different height positions. There are mainly two different ways to determine the actual positions: to assume the positions or to use force equilibrium and to calculate the positions. To find the correct solution the geometry and the force equilibrium are used which will give each roller&#39;s position_ along the flank. This method demands knowledge of all parts of the chain_ even the slack part. Therefore it has been necessary to model both the connecting tight and the slack spans in which power between the two sprockets is transmitted. The gravitational force acting at the chain has been included in the complete model so that the position of the rollers and the forces in the links at the slack span can be calculated. The elastic deformation in the chain has also been included. The moment of inertia in the two sprockets and in the outer geometry has been taken into account_ but not the inertia forces in the chain.","A method to determine the dynamic load distribution in a chain drive"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated supplement use in 1127 men with incident PCa and in 900 population controls in Sweden. Age-adjusted binary regression with an identity link was carried out to estimate prevalence differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Modifying effects of lifestyle- and diet-related factors were explored by statistical assessment of additive interaction. RESULTS: Among men with PCa_ 542 individuals (48%) had used supplements_ which was a 10% (95% CI: 5.9%-15%) higher prevalence than among population controls. Among individuals with high intake of fatty fish_ vegetables_ and phytoestrogens_ but low intake of saturated fat_ supplement use was 29% (95% CI: 18%-41%) more common in men with PCa than in population controls. We found no evidence of heterogeneity by categories of education_ smoking history_ body mass index_ fiber_ fruit_ or phytoestrogen intake_ treatment_ or disease stage.

The National Kidney Foundation guidelines favour the use of statin therapy for treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with CKD. Much evidence supports statin therapy for reducing CVD and improving outcomes in the general population_ but there is less evidence in patients with CKD. Consequently_ prevention of CVD in CKD is based primarily on extrapolation from non-CKD trials. Significantly_ in trials specifically designed to investigate patients with CKD_ evidence is emerging for improved cardiovascular outcomes with statin therapy. This review describes available data relating to cardiovascular outcomes and the role of statins in patients with CKD_ including pre-dialysis_ dialysis_ and renal transplant patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The PubMed database was searched (1998-present) to ensure comprehensive identification of publications (including randomised clinical trials) relevant to CKD patients_ patterns of cardiovascular outcome in such patients and their relationship to lipid profile_ and the role of statins for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular complications. RESULTS: There are conflicting data on the relationship between dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular outcomes_ with one major study of statin therapy (4D--Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie) providing equivocal results. Further studies_ including AURORA (A study to evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in subjects On Regular haemodialysis: an Assessment of survival and cardiovascular events; NCT00240331) in patients receiving haemodialysis_ and SHARP (Study of Heart And Renal Protection; NCT00125593) in patients with CKD including those on dialysis_ should help to clarify the role of statin therapy in these populations. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are needed to elucidate the role of statins in improving cardiovascular outcomes for CKD patients. It is anticipated that ongoing clinical trials geared towards the optimal prevention and treatment of CVD in patients with CKD will help guide clinicians in the management of CKD.","Cardiovascular disease in patients with renal disease: the role of statins."
"oai_services_scigloo_org_114362_7","Background The return to work process has been found to be influenced by employers’ attitudes and measures_ and the supervisors’ role has been described as significant. In the early nineties_ legislation in Sweden increased employers’ responsibility regarding rehabilitation back to work for employees on sick leave. The purpose of the study was to explore supervisors’ views on employer responsibility in the return to work process and factors influencing the support of sick-listed employees. Method The focus group methodology was used. It has the form of group discussions and is suitable for picking up the views and experiences of a selected group. Six groups were conducted and each group met on one occasion. Totally 23 supervisors experienced in managing sick-listed employees participated. They were in majority public employed. Result Two different themes emerged; In “The Supervisor is the Key Person” the participants found themselves as being key persons_ carrying the main responsibility for the rehabilitation of the sick-listed employees and for creating a good working environment_ thus preventing ill health and sick-listing among the employees. In the second theme “Influential Factors in Rehabilitation Work” the participants described the rehabilitation work as a part of a greater whole influenced by society_ demands and resources of the workplace and the interplay between all parties involved. The supervisor’s interplay with the parties involved_ inside and outside the workplace_ was described as essential to the rehabilitation work_ as was the interplay between the sick-listed and the workmates. However_ the participants saw a conflict between keeping the budget balanced and finding suitable tasks for the sick-listed employee returning to work. Conclusions The study gives us the supervisors’ perspective of the complexity of the rehabilitation back to work and this knowledge can to be used by rehabilitation professionals to improve and develop successful collaboration in occupational rehabilitation.","Supervisors’ view on employer responsibility in the return to work process.

In this study_ nanoscale osseointegration has been studied via laser-modified titanium implants. The micro- and nano-structured implants were placed in the proximal tibia of New Zealand white rabbits for six months. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)_ analytical microscopy_ including energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM)_ as well as electron tomography studies were used to investigate the degree of nano-osseointegration in two- and three-dimensions. HRTEM indicated the laser-modified surface encouraged the formation of crystalline hydroxyapatite in the immediate vicinity of the implant. Analytical studies suggested the presence of a functionally graded interface at the implant surface_ characterized by the gradual intermixing of bone with oxide layer. Yet_ the most compelling of techniques_ which enabled straightforward visualization of nano-osseointegration_ proved to be segmentation of electron tomographic reconstructions_ where thresholding techniques identified bone penetrating into the nanoscale roughened surface features of laser-modified titanium. Combining high-resolution_ analytical and three-dimensional electron microscopy techniques has proven to encourage identification and understanding of nano-osseointegration.","Where bone meets implant: the characterization of nano-osseointegration."

The drag force acting on the cavity and the aft plate were measured and the water-air interface was monitored in different conditions. Behavioural changes to the free surface were observed by changing the geometry and flow characteristics like air pressure_ air flow rate and water flow speed. Computational model for different cases with the same geometry and conditions were simulated using computational fluid dynamics(CFD). The length of the cavity was designed to include approximately 2.5 times the expected wavelength of the water-air interface with Froude number based on the ship length of 0.19 which approximately represents a displacement ship with multi-wave air cavity at its cruising speed. Parameters like cavity pressure play an important role for the wave’s shape and the stability of the free surface inside the cavity. Both computation and experiment show that the amplitude of the wave is sensitive to the air pressure in the cavity and the re-attachment of the water to the rear end of the cavity has a close correlation to the inlet air pressure and water velocity. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to minimize effective power including air supply while reducing resistance in/around the cavity_ but equally important is it to gain amore basic understanding of the air-cavity’s behaviour and possible additional resistance components.","Hydrodynamics of a Displacement Air Cavity Ship"

In addition_ it is well known that some elderly people have brain amyloidosis without showing signs of cognitive impairment or neurodegeneration beyond the age norm. Biomarkers_ reviewed extensively in a recent Perspectives article in Alzheimer's & Dementia_ suggest that amyloid-positive individuals are at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease than similarly aged individuals without evidence of brain amyloidosis_ provided they live long enough. But how can the brain resist amyloid pathology for many years? Here_ we expand on recent biomarker studies suggesting that Aβ build-up and toxicity may occur in two phases. We hypothesize that the first phase may involve an autocatalytic build-up of a nontoxic Aβ reservoir_ tentatively named the Aβ(Cat) pool_ and that gain of toxicity may require brain incubation of Aβ in the water-deprived plaque milieu over years to produce modified forms of the protein that are truly neurotoxic (Aβ(Tox)). We argue for the need to describe the molecular natures of Aβ(Cat) and Aβ(Tox) in greater detail as a means to gain success in anti-Aβ disease-modifying drug development.","Biomarker evidence for uncoupling of amyloid build-up and toxicity in Alzheimer's disease."

An electronic search was undertaken including papers from 2004 onwards. The titles and abstracts from these results were read to identify studies within the selection criteria. All reference lists of the selected studies were then hand-searched_ this time without time restrictions. A narrative review discussed some findings from the first two parts where separate data from non-comparative studies may have indicated conclusions different from those possible to draw in the systematic analysis. It may be suggested that the following situations are correlated to increase the implant failure rate: a low insertion torque of implants that are planned to be immediately or early loaded_ inexperienced surgeons inserting the implants_ implant insertion in the maxilla_ implant insertion in the posterior region of the jaws_ implants in heavy smokers_ implant insertion in bone qualities type III and IV_ implant insertion in places with small bone volumes_ use of shorter length implants_ greater number of implants placed per patient_ lack of initial implant stability_ use of cylindrical (non-threaded) implants and prosthetic rehabilitation with implant-supported overdentures. Moreover_ it may be suggested that the following situations may be correlated with an increase in the implant failure rate: use of the non-submerged technique_ immediate loading_ implant insertion in fresh extraction sockets_ smaller diameter implants.

"oai_services_scigloo_org_38437_7","This thesis is about two areas: namely_ mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and management accounting and control systems (MACS). M&As have grown_ measured both in numbers and size_ in recent decades and have become very popular strategic business tactics to achieve economies of scale and scope. In fact_ some believe that they have even exceeded the internal or "organic" growth of organizations. However_ approximately two of every three M&As fail to achieve the intended goals which were the stated reasons for the business deal. The explanation given for this high failure rate is often bad integration management. MACS_ on the other hand_ are important parts of the entire control mechanisms used to motivate_ monitor_ measure_ and sanction the actions of managers and employees in organizations. This function of MACS can also be assumed to be true when it comes to organizations involved in M&As. The main purpose of this study is to bring these two research areas together by developing a model that shows the important variables and how they determine MACS' involvement in M&A integration processes. The main motivation for this thesis is the recognized lack of such studies which are oriented towards both research areas although there are many implicit studies that deal with the issues involved. The aim is therefore to collect the few explicit and the many implicit studies' content and build a model that can be used for further research. Hence_ the method used is the collection_ study and analysis of the relevant literature in the two research fields in order to generate variables that explain MACS involvement in M&A integration processes. The results show that the role and function of MACS in M&A integration processes can be interpreted in many different ways_ above all depending on which perspective/view is used. The research area under investigation can furthermore be recognized in the context of different dimensions_ namely a socio-cultural one_ a political-ideological one_ and a technical one. The perspectives used and the dimensions through which MACS are put into context determine to a large extent how their role and function are described. These fairly theoretical and research dependent variables also have an impact on how more pragmatic variables are described. Four such main groups of pragmatic variables are defined in the thesis. The group that is at the most macro-level here is the group containing attributes and characteristics of the two organizations involved (size_ age_ structure_ strategy_ environment_ culture_ management style).","Modeling Management Accounting and Control in the Integration Processes of Mergers & Acquisitions"

For the first time_ absolute DR cross sections have been measured for H+(H2O)3 in the energy range of 0.001–0.8 eV_ and relative cross sections have been measured for D+(D2O)3 in the energy range of 0.001–1.0 eV. The DR cross sections for H+(H2O)3 are larger than previously observed for H+(H2O)n (n=1_2)_ which is in agreement with the previously observed trend indicating that the DR rate coefficient increases with size of the water cluster ion. Branching ratios have been determined for the dominating product channels. Dissociative recombination of H+(H2O)3 mainly results in the formation of 3H2O+H (probability of 0.95±0.05) and with a possible minor channel resulting in 2H2O+OH+H2 (0.05±0.05). The dominating channels for DR of D+(D2O)3 are 3D2O+D (0.88±0.03) and 2D2O+OD+D2 (0.09±0.02).

RESULTS: Liver-specific knock-out of the IGF-1 gene by use of the cre-loxP system caused enhanced liver growth_ possibly reflecting increased growth hormone (GH) secretion due to decreased negative feedback by IGF-1. Studies on cultured rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC) showed that IGF-1 and hepatocyte-conditioned medium (PCcM) time- and dose-dependently increased hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNA and HGF immunoreactivity. IGF-1 and PCcM also enhanced DNA synthesis in the HSC cultures. The PCcM did not contain bioactive IGF-1 and was also able to stimulate proliferation when prepared under serum- and hormone-free conditions. CONCLUSION: In vivo results show that IGF-1 is not essential for normal growth of the intact liver. The in vitro results indicate that both IGF-1 and IGF- 1-independent factor(s) from hepatocytes can stimulate HGF production by HSC. It remains to be investigated whether these effects are of importance for liver regeneration or pathological conditions.","Possible roles of insulin-like growth factor in regulation of physiological and pathophysiological liver growth."

The sample consisted of 782 Swedish in-patients at a gynaecological_ a medical_ an orthopaedic_ and a surgical department. The median age was 59 years and 55% of the patients were women. Data were collected using the Quality from the Patient’s Perspective (QPP) Questionnaire and the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire. The QPP consists of 61 items designed to measure the following four quality dimensions: the medical-technical competence and the degree of identity-orientation in the actions of the caregivers_ the physical-technical conditions and the socio-cultural atmosphere of the care organization. Each question is posed in two different ways in the QPP; one measures perceived reality of the item in question and one the subjective importance the patient ascribes to it. Results showed that patients’ ratings of perceived reality covaried systematically with their sense of coherence. This was particularly the case on questions rated by experts to be more abstract and emotionally loaded. Patients’ ratings of the subjective importance of the items were weakly related to their sense of coherence. The results are discussed in terms of negative affectivity and culturally shared ideals regarding quality of care.","Patients' views on quality of care"

The investigation was based on two mail surveys_ one conducted in 1987 and the other in 2006. The results suggested that the gross hunting value and the hunting cost share of this value increased over the two decades. The consumer surplus (net value) share decreased correspondingly_ while the recreation share and the meat share of the hunting value were more stable over time. It appeared that in 1987 as well as in 2006 the southern Swedish hunters tended to value their hunting higher than the hunters in northern Sweden_ especially when it came to the recreation. The results should be relevant in the context of game management_ adaptive game management in particular.","The hunting value of game in Sweden: Have changes occurred over recent decades?"

In comparison with the sedentary group the following differences were found: a) percentage fast twitch fibers was lower in the endurance athetes_ b) fast to slow twitch muscle fiber area ratio was higher in the track athletes_ c)track athletes and downhill skier attained higher peak torque values at all angular velocities examined. The track athletes had_ however_ higher torque values at the fastest angular velocity as compared to the downhill skiers_ whereas there was no differnce under isometric conditions. The proportion of fast twitch fibers was related to torque produced_ especially at high motion velocity.

The game is primarily designed for confirmation education in the Church of Sweden_ with the purpose to create interest in the Old Testament. In this paper we describe our experiences with the process of creating a game where the work has been guided by three_ in some cases_ contradictory goals; the source authenticity_ the educational value_ and the gaming entertainment. A pilot study is also presented in which confirmands have been interviewed focusing on their experiences from playing the game_ as part of their confirmation studies.Our conclusion is that clear requirements for the entertainment must be created as a counterweight to the practical aspects' requirements_ e.g. education and authenticity. To create requirements for game expericene_ it can be useful to identify a game genre and find a game that can serve as a template. One consequence of the fact that a specific goal for entertainment and a very clear requirement on content existed was that a number of fundamental contradictions could be identified (e.g. narrative_ game mechanics_ adaptation). When these inconsistencies were encountered_ a suitable approach could be chosen in order to reach a compromise. If an existing game used as a reference wasn't available_ it is likely that the entertainment would have suffered for the benefit of the educational aspects and biblical authenticity. The pilot evaluation shows that the confirmands appreciate Testament for its gaming qualities and that they express a positive and curious attitude towards the biblical content presented in the game.","Making a Game of the Old Testament Balancing Authenticity_ Education and Entertainment"

Up to a Mn coverage of 3–4 monolayers (ML)_ island formation is favored. For higher Mn coverages up to 12 ML uniform film growth is found. The silicide film morphology at low coverages supports a layered Mn-Si film structure. The silicide surfaces displayed a √3×√3 LEED pattern. STM images recorded from the √3×√3 surfaces mostly show a hexagonal pattern but a honeycomb pattern has also been observed. A surface atomic structure based on chained Mn triangles is proposed. Our STM results are in good agreement with a recent theoretical model. The high-quality STS spectra recorded from the different surfaces show a clear metallic character at 1.5 ML and higher coverages.

This study investigated the effect of organic load on phosphorus (P) and bacteria removal by reactive filter materials under real-life treatment conditions. Two long-term column experiments were conducted at very short hydraulic residence times (average similar to 5.5 h)_ using wastewater with high (mean similar to 120 mg L-1) and low (mean similar to 20 mg L-1) BOD7 values. Two alkaline filter materials_ the calcium-silicate material Polonite and blast furnace slag (BFS)_ were tested for the removal capacity of total P_ total organic carbon (TOC) and Enterococci. Both experiments showed that Polonite removed P significantly ( p &lt; 0.01) better than BFS. An increase in P removal efficiency of 29.3% was observed for the Polonite filter at the lower concentration of BOD7 ( p &lt; 0.05). Polonite was also better than BFS with regard to removal of TOC_ but there were no significant differences between the two filter materials with regard to removal of Enterococci. The reduction in Enterococci was greater in the experiment using wastewater with high BOD7_ an effect attributable to the higher concentration of bacteria in that wastewater. Overall_ the results demonstrate the importance of extensive pre-treatment of wastewater to achieve good phosphorus removal in reactive bed filters and prolonged filter life.","Effect of organic load on phosphorus and bacteria removal from wastewater using alkaline filter materials"

In contrast to traditional monitoring_ neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process_ which simplifies application development_ but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking_ which is configurable to support different types of management applications - from exact matching for database-style queries to loose_ approximate matching_ which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further_ we present the design of a search node_ which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system_ on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers_ executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth136469_7","Surfactants_ surface reacting agents_ lower the surface tension of the interface between fluids in multiphase flow. This capability of surfactants makes them ideal for many applications_ including wetting_ foaming_ and dispersing. Due to their molecular composition_ surfactants are adsorbed from the bulk fluid to the interface between the fluids_ leading to different concentrations on the interface and in the fluid. In a previous paper [21]_ we introduced a new second order method using uniform grids to simulate insoluble surfactants in multiphase flow. This method used Strang splitting allowing for a fully second order treatment in time. Here_ we use the same numerical methods to explicitly represent the singular interface_ treat the interfacial surfactant concentration_ and couple with the Navier-Stokes equations. Now_ we introduce a second order method for the surfactants in the bulk that continues to allow the use of regular grids for the full problem. Difficulties arise since the boundary condition for the bulk concentration_ which handles the flux of surfactant between the interface and bulk fluid_ is applied at the interface which cuts arbitrarily through the regular grid. We extend the embedded boundary method_ introduced in [22]_ to handle this challenge. Through our results_ we present the effect of the solubility of the surfactants. We show results of drop dynamics due to resulting Marangoni stresses and of drop deformations in shear flow in the presence of soluble surfactants. There is a large nondimensional parameter space over which we try to understand the drop dynamics.","An embedded boundary method for soluble surfactants with interface tracking for two-phase flows"

This requires adaptation of the working conditions to compensate for age related visual changes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to compile and structure knowledge concerning age related changes in visual and non-visual functions among older-age workers and to describe in what way these changes relate to light and work performance. METHOD: An overview of the literature was performed in PubMed and EMBASE concerning visual changes among elderly people_ light_ visual ergonomics and consequences at work. RESULTS: Visual conditions and lighting design have an impact on work performance in those over age 65 even if there are few studies available. Natural age related changes in the eyes or ocular diseases can result in reduced visual function and performance. Moreover_ evidence of the importance of light and dark rhythms for circadian regulation is mounting; there are indications that the older-age population might need specific attention related to this issue. Finally_ visual deteriorations might also_ secondarily_ induce strained postures and musculoskeletal symptoms_ pain and injury. CONCLUSION: Age-related changes in the eyes and also ocular diseases among older-age people have an impact on well-being and work performance_ and therefore call for reconsideration of their working conditions.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth148765_7","The amount of wear occurring in high-performance rolling and sliding contacts is often quite small_ and such contact surfaces often become glossy. To obtain good contact conditions_ it is necessary that the form and the topography of the surfaces be good_ that the materials and treatments be properly chosen_ and that the lubrication be adequate for the contact. Such advantageous conditions - often referred to as 'mild' - are what engineers normally strive to attain. Sometimes severe conditions may arise_ however_ creating rough or scored surfaces; severe wear conditions are normally unacceptable in any modern high-performance machine. Predicting the amount of mild wear is generally thought to be rather difficult and uncertain; this paper addresses this difficult task_ outlining some possibilities for predicting mild wear in rolling and sliding contacts. Typical machine elements that include high-performance rolling and sliding contact surfaces are gears_ cam mechanisms_ and roller bearings. If the rolling and sliding contacts are moving under boundary or mixed lubricated conditions_ the contact surfaces may be subject to mild wear. If the lubricants in the rolling and sliding contacts are contaminated with particles_ wear may occur even if full-film conditions are predominant. In a rolling and sliding contact_ the two interacting surfaces characteristically move at different speeds in a tangential direction. The Tribology Group at KTH Machine Design has worked on simulating wear in rolling and sliding contacts for a fairly long time. Themodelling principles the Group has successfully used are based on 1) the single-point observation method and 2) treating wear as an initial-value process. Two simple examples will be presented here_ demonstrating how these principles can be used. As well_ some of the Group's efforts at simulating mild wear in rolling and sliding contacts will be presented.","Wear Simulation with a Focus on Mild Wear in Rolling and Sliding Contacts"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth149299_7","The use of supply jet flows is the most common type of air distribution for general ventilation. Usually the supply flow rate is constant or slowly varying (VAV-systems) to cope with a varying load. A novel air distribution method_ with the potential to reduce stagnation and to increase the ventilation efficiency_ is to introduce rapid flow variations (pulsations). This paper reports on a fundamental study of this type of air distribution. The purpose of the study was to explore the effect of flow variations on stagnant zones and the levels of the turbulent kinetic energy and the relative turbulence intensity. A small scale room model is used that consists of an enclosure with a ventilation supply at the bottom and an extract at the top of the opposite wall. Water was used as an operating fluid and the model had a design which mainly generated a two-dimensional flow. The size of the model made it possible to investigate the two-dimensional velocity vector field using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method in regions corresponding to occupied regions. Further post processing was conducted from the resulting vector fields. The comparison between cases of constant inflow and pulsated inflow (flow variations with frequency of 0.5 Hz) was conducted for three domains: two belonging to the far-field occupied zone and one belonging to the near-field_ downstream of the supply wall jet.            ","PIV Study of Ventilation Quality in Certain Occupied Regions of a Two-Dimensional Room Model with Rapidly Varying Flow Rates"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth25707_7","We carry out direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional turbulence with forcing at different wave numbers and resolutions up to 32768^2 gridpoints. In the absence of large scale drag_ a state is reached where enstrophy is quasistationary while energy is growing. In the enstrophy cascade range the energy spectrum has the form $ E(k) = K \epsilon_{\omega} ^{2/3} k^{-3} $_ without any logarithmic correction_ where$ \epsilon_{\omega} $ is the enstrophy dissipation and K is of the order of unity. However_ K is varying between different simulations and is thus not a perfect constant. This variation can be understood as a consequence of large-scale dissipation intermittency_ following the argument by Landau (Landau \&amp; Lifshitz 1959).  In the presence of a large scale drag_ we obtain a slightly steeper spectrum. When forcing is applied at a scale which is somewhat smaller than the computational domain no vortices are formed and the statistics remain close to Gaussian in the enstrophy cascade range. When forcing is applied at a smaller scale_ long lived coherent vortices form at larger scales  than the forcing scale and intermittency measures become very large at all scales_ including the scales of the enstrophy cascade. We conclude that the enstrophy cascade with a $ k^{-3} $-spectrum_ is a robust feature of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. However_ there is a complete lack of universality of higher order statistics of vorticity increments in the enstrophy cascade range.","The enstrophy cascade in forced two-dimensional turbulence"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth29568_7","New methodologies and concepts for developing compact and energy efficient automotive exhaust systems have been studied. This originates in the growing concern for global warming_ to which road transportation is a major contributor. The focus has been on commercial vehicles—most often powered by diesel engines—for which the emission legislation has been dramatically increased over the last decade. The emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides have been successfully reduced by the introduction of filters and catalytic converters_ but the fuel consumption_ which basically determines the emissions of carbon dioxides_ has not been improved accordingly. The potential reduction of fuel consumption by optimising the exhaust after-treatment system (assuming fixed after-treatment components) of a typical heavy-duty commercial vehicle is ~4%_ which would have a significant impact on both the environment and the overall economy of the vehicle.First_ methodologies to efficiently model complex flow duct networks such as exhaust systems are investigated. The well-established linear multiport approach is extended to include flow-acoustic interaction effects. This introduces an effective way of quantifying amplification and attenuation of incident sound_ and_ perhaps more importantly_ the possibility of predicting nonlinear phenomena such as self-sustained oscillations—whistling—using linear models. The methodology is demonstrated on T-junctions_ which is a configuration well known to be prone to self-sustained oscillations for grazing flow past the side branch orifice. It is shown_ and validated experimentally_ that the existence and frequency of self-sustained oscillations can be predicted using linear theory.Further_ the aeroacoustics of T-junctions are studied. A test rig for the full determination of the scattering matrix defining the linear three-port representing the T-junction is developed_ allowing for any combination of grazing-bias flow. It is shown that the constructive flow-acoustic coupling not only varies with the flow configuration but also with the incidence of the acoustic disturbance. Configurations where flow from the side branch joins the grazing flow are still prone to whistling_ while flow bleeding off from the main branch effectively cancels any constructive flow-acoustic coupling.Two silencer concepts are evaluated: first the classic Herschel-Quincke tube and second a novel modified flow reversal silencer. The Herschel-Quincke tube is capable of providing effective attenuation with very low pressure loss penalty. The attenuation conditions are derived and their sensitivity to mean flow explained. Two implementations have been modelled using the multiport methodology and then validated experimentally. The first configuration_ where the nodal points are composed of T-junctions_ proves to be an example where internal reflections in the system can provide sufficient feedback for self-sustained oscillation. Again_ this is predicted accurately by the linear theory. The second implementation_ with nodal points made from Y-junctions_ was designed to allow for equal flow distribution between the two parallel ducts_ thus allowing for the demonstration of the passive properties of the system. Experimental results presented for these two configurations correlate well with the derived theory.The second silencer concept studied consists of a flow reversal chamber that is converted to a resonator by acoustically short-circuiting the inlet and outlet ducts. The eigenfrequency of the resonator is easily shifted by varying the geometry of the short circuit_ thus making the proposed concept ideal for implementation as a semi-active device. Again the concept is modelled using the multiport approach and validated experimentally. It is shown to provide significant attenuation over a wide frequency range with a very compact design_ while adding little or no pressure loss to the system.","Aeroacoustics Studies of Duct Branches with Application to Silencers"

Aconsistent sample_ containing a representative fraction of thedissolved and colloidal substances (DCS) present in the bulkfurnish_ was achieved by preventing cake formation on a filtersurface. A combination of turbulent flow above a membranefilter_ while continuously withdrawing a relatively low samplevolume_ were key factors in the prevention of filterfouling.For the continuous flow-extraction of DCS_ a technique isdescribed whereby the extracting solvent was injected at a highvelocity into a continuous flow of analyte (Paper II).Comparison with conventional flow extraction showed anextraction enhancement of up to 9 times for colloidaltriglycerides.To achieve a continuous determination of chemicalsubstances_ a real-time fully automated colorimetric titrationapparatus was developed (Paper III&amp;IV). This was achievedby using a series of micro-machined mixing channels for thecontinuous flow of analyte_ with a sequence of detection unitsand titrant addition points along the flowpath (Paper III). Afuzzy logiccontroller was implemented to continuously adaptfor changes in the sample concentration_ providing thepossibility of titrating over two orders of magnitude in sampleconcentration with minimal loss of accuracy (Paper IV).Also_ a system is presented whereby the filtration apparatus(Paper I) is combined with the titration device (Paper III&amp;IV) in order to continuously determine total charge (orcolloidal charge) of a paper furnish in real-time (Paper V).This was achieved by utilising a back-titration approach andselected examples are presented showing the dynamicinteractions between wood fibres and polyelectrolyte adsorptionat various conditions of pH and polyelectrolyte molecularweight.Finally_ some suggestions for a more comprehensive wet-endchemical monitoring platform are discussed and the role of thepresent work in evaluated in this context.Keywords:Chemical monitoring_ continuous flowextraction_ cross-flow filtration_ dissolved and colloidalcomponents_ fuzzy-logic control_ on-line system_ pitchanalysis_ polyelectrolyte titration_ process control_ samplework-up_ titrimetric analysis.","New Techniques for Continuous Chemical Analysis in the Pulp&amp;Paper Industry"

"oai_DiVA_org_liu25726_7","This thesis is based upon studies of quantitative and qualitative determinations of immunoglobulins A_ G_ and M (lgA_ IgG_ and IgM) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in serum. Inflammatory diseases_ such as multiple sclerosis and infections (e.g. meningitis) affecting the central nervous system are characterized by intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins_ and therefore determinations of them in CSF are important diagnostic tools.A non-linear relationship between the CSF/serum ratios of IgG_ IgA_ IgM_ and albumin was found in patients with damaged blood-CSF barrier_ but in whom no intrathecal synthesis orimmunoglobulins was expected. On the basis of this non-linear relationship a new kind of formula_ the extended indices (lgA-EI_ IgG-EI_ and IgM-EI)_ was developed to giveimproved estimates of intrathecal synthesis.These formulae were evaluated together with other proposed formulae and with agarose isoelectrofocusing_ to determine their diagnostic sensitivities in different neurological diseases. The main advantage with the extended indices_ compared to other formulae_ was a lower rate offalse positive tests_ without affecting the diagnostic sensitivities for intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.A method based on ultracentrifugation is presented_ where the distribution of monomeric and dimeric IgA in CSF and serum can be determined quantitatively. Both total and Ilerpes simplex virus specific lgA antibodies were estimated with respect to the physical form of lgA.For determination of CSF-IgM the sampling should be performed with an atraumatic Sprotte needle to minimise pre-analytical errors owing to contamination with serum or interstitial fluid.","Diagnostic methods for demonstration of intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulines within the central nervous system"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu104650_7","A novel strategy for site-specific and covalent attachment of proteins has been developed_ intended for robust and controllable immobilization of histidine (His)-tagged ligands in protein microarrays. The method is termed chelation assisted photoimmobilization (CAP) and was demonstrated using human IgG-Fc modified with C-terminal hexahistidines (His-IgGFc) as the ligand and protein A as the analyte. Alkanethiols terminated with either nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)_ benzophenone (BP); or oligo(ethylene glycol) were synthesized and mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were prepared on gold and thoroughly characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS)_ ellipsometry_ and contact angle goniometry. In the process of CAP_ NTA chelates Ni2+ and the complex coordinates the His-tagged ligand in an oriented assembly. The ligand is then photoimmobilized via BP_ which forms covalent bonds upon UV light activation. In the development of affinity biosensors and protein microarrays_ site-specific attachment of ligands in a fashion where analyte binding sites are available is often preferred to random coupling. Analyte binding performance of ligands immobilized either by CAP or by standard amine coupling was characterized by surface plasmon resonance in combination with IRAS. The relative analyte response with randomly coupled ligand was 2.5 times higher than when site-specific attachment was used. This is a reminder that also when immobilizing ligands via residues far from the binding site_ there are many other factors influencing availability and activity. Still_ CAP provides a valuable expansion of protein immobilization techniques since it offers attractive microarraying possibilities amenable to applications within proteomics.","Site-Specific and Covalent Attachment of His-Tagged Proteins by Chelation Assisted Photoimmobilization: A Strategy for Microarraying of Protein Ligands"

The focus is mainly on inorganic materials in the solid state. In a first part_ after a brief overview of the so-called ab initio methods with their approximations_ constraints_ and limitations_ recommendations are made for a good usage of first-principles codes with a set of qualifiers. Examples are given to illustrate the power and the limitations of ab initio codes. However_ despite the "success" of these methodologies_ thermodynamics of complex multi-component alloys_ as used in engineering applications_ requires a more versatile approach presently afforded within CALPHAD. Hence_ in a second part_ the links that presently exist between ab initio methodologies_ experiments_ and the CALPHAD approach are examined with illustrations. Finally_ the issues of dynamical instability and of the role of lattice vibrations that still constitute the subject of ample discussions within the CALPHAD community are revisited in the light of our current knowledge with a set of recommendations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"oai_DiVA_org_liu60850_7","This article presents a novel non-reflective boundary condition for the free surface incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Boundaries of this type are very useful when_ for example_ simulating water flow around a ship moving over a wide ocean. Normally waves generated by the ship will reflect off of the boundaries of the simulation domain and as these reflected waves returns towards the ship they will cause undesired interference patterns.By employing a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) approach we have derived a boundary condition that absorbs incoming waves and thus efficiently prevents these undesired wave reflections. To solve the resulting boundary equations we present a fast and stable algorithm based on the Stable Fluids approach. Through numerical experiments we then show that our boundaries are significantly more effective than simpler reflection preventing techniques. We also provide a thorough analysis of the parameters involved in our boundary formulation and show how they effect wave absorption efficiency.","A PML Based Non-Reflective Boundary for Free Surface Fluid Animation"

The following metals were studied: Cadmium (Cd)_Chromium (Cr)_ Copper (Cu)_ Lead (Pb)_ Mercury (Hg)_ Nickel (Ni) and Zinc (Zn). A major part ofthe metals are found in a protected environment where degrading processes like corrosion are mostlimited. However_ during the lifetime of some goods the metal release to the environment is significant.The quantitatively most dominant emissions were found for Cu and Zn. The tap water system androofs/fronts (Cu) represent goods with large exposed areas but with relatively small release rates perunit. In contrast_ brake linings_ aerial lines and electrical grounding (Cu) and tyres_ brake linings andchemicals (Zn) are all goods with high release rates but mostly limited exposed stocks. High yearlyemissions are also found for Pb_ ammunition and sinkers dominate the calculated emissions totally.For Cr and Ni_ stainless steel represent the major part of the stocks_ but corrosion was estimated togive only a minor contribution to the emissions. Potential emission sources_ i.e. stabilisers_ pigmentsand plated goods dominate the exposed Cd stock. These emissions were not quantified due to lackof data. Hg is currently phased out_ but one major source of emission_ i.e. the use of amalgam_ willbe continuously significant for several decades. The importance of the traffic sector is obvious. Theemissions from brake linings (Cu_ Zn and Pb)_ tyres (Zn_ Pb_ Cr and Ni) and asphalt wear (Cu_ Zn_Cr_ Ni and Pb) are all of large importance for the total emission from respectively metal.","Goods in the Anthroposphere as a Metal Emission Source"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu47817_7","We present a multilayer model for analysis of Hall effect data of semiconductor structures composed of sublayers with different thicknesses and contacts placed on the top surface. Based on the circuit theory we analyze the contributions of the conductivity of every sublayer and derive general expressions for the conductivity and carrier mobility of a multilayer planar sample. The circuit analysis is performed taking into account the fact that the sample sublayers are partially connected in parallel to each other by series resistances formed in areas lying below the contacts from each upper layer. In order to solve the inverse problem of determining the electrical parameters of one of the sublayers_ a procedure for analysis of the Hall effect data is proposed. The model is simplified for a structure composed of two layers with the same type of conductivity_ and is used to determine the electrical parameters of GaN films grown on relatively thick GaN buffers.","Multilayer model for Hall effect data analysis of semiconductor structures with step-changed conductivity"

In both scientiﬁ c accounts and everyday use_ the identity concept has tradi- tionally been seen as something that individuals possess. This view has however been heavily criticized by a social identity strand of social science_ where identity is a matter of a negotiation where different social roles are learned in relations with others. The relational view of identities creates some serious problems for the sustainability challenge. In a world of relational identities_ individuals are engaged in identity-creating interactions every day.

"oai_DiVA_org_miun7231_7","BACKGROUND: Social support is important during pregnancy and childbirth and the partner is usually the main source of support. Lack of partner support is associated with less emotional well-being and discontinuation of breastfeeding. RESEARCH PROBLEM: The purpose of the study was to investigate the proportion of women dissatisfied with partner support in early pregnancy_ and to identify risk factors associated with dissatisfaction through a follow up 2 months and 1 year after childbirth. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A national cohort of 2430 Swedish speaking women recruited in early pregnancy and followed up 2 months and 1 year postpartum. Data were collected by means of three postal questionnaires. RESULTS: Five percent of women were dissatisfied with partner support in early pregnancy. Women dissatisfied with partner support were more likely to be multiparas_ not living with their partner in early pregnancy and to report unfavorable timing of pregnancy. They experienced more physical symptoms_ and less emotional well-being in terms of more depressive symptoms_ more major worries and a lower sense of coherence. One year after childbirth a higher rate of divorces and disappointment with the partner's participation in childcare and household chores and understanding from partner was found in women being dissatisfied in early pregnancy. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that it might be possible to identify women who are lacking partner support already in early pregnancy. Women's social network and their support from partner should be investigated by health care providers and women in need of additional support should be refereed to available community resources.","Partner support in the childbearing period"

Little is known about whether having friendships found exclusively online may impact self-esteem and forming offline friendships for these adolescents. This study therefore aimed to provide insight into the moderating role of shyness in the longitudinal interplay between friendships in online and offline contexts in early adolescence. Adolescents and their friends (193 girls_ 196 boys; M-age = 13.29) were followed with three consecutive measurements with intervals of eight months. Results showed that particularly for shy adolescents_ having friends exclusively online predicted increases in self-esteem. Self-esteem_ in turn_ was found to predict forming more friendships found both offline and online and forming more friendships found exclusively offline. Thus_ findings supported the social compensation perspective that shy adolescents may benefit from having friends exclusively online_ as these friendships may increase self-esteem_ thereby facilitating the formation of friendships found partially and completely offline.

"oai_DiVA_org_umu160_7","This thesis deals with the development of efficient and reliable algorithms and library software for factorizing matrices and solving matrix equations on high-performance computer systems. The architectures of today's computers consist of multiple processors_ each with multiple functional units. The memory systems are hierarchical with several levels_ each having different speed and size. The practical peak performance of a system is reached only by considering all of these characteristics. One portable method for achieving good system utilization is to express a linear algebra problem in terms of level 3 BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram) transformations. The most important operation is GEMM (GEneral Matrix Multiply)_ which typically defines the practical peak performance of a computer system. There are efficient GEMM implementations available for almost any platform_ thus an algorithm using this operation is highly portable.The dissertation focuses on how recursion can be applied to solve linear algebra problems. Recursive linear algebra algorithms have the potential to automatically match the size of subproblems to the different memory hierarchies_ leading to much better utilization of the memory system. Furthermore_ recursive algorithms expose level 3 BLAS operations_ and reveal task parallelism. The first paper handles the Cholesky factorization for matrices stored in packed format. Our algorithm uses a recursive packed matrix data layout that enables the use of high-performance matrix--matrix multiplication_ in contrast to the standard packed format. The resulting library routine requires half the memory of full storage_ yet the performance is better than for full storage routines.Paper two and tree introduce recursive blocked algorithms for solving triangular Sylvester-type matrix equations. For these problems_ recursion together with superscalar kernels produce new algorithms that give 10-fold speedups compared to existing routines in the SLICOT and LAPACK libraries. We show that our recursive algorithms also have a significant impact on the execution time of solving unreduced problems and when used in condition estimation. By recursively splitting several problem dimensions simultaneously_ parallel algorithms for shared memory systems are obtained. The fourth paper introduces a library---RECSY---consisting of a set of routines implemented in Fortran 90 using the ideas presented in paper two and three. Using performance monitoring tools_ the last paper evaluates the possible gain in using different matrix blocking layouts and the impact of superscalar kernels in the RECSY library.","Recursive Blocked Algorithms_ Data Structures_ and High-Performance Software for Solving Linear Systems and Matrix Equations"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu38845_7","The 11th February_ 2010 marked the commemoration of the thirty-first anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran. In 1979_ the Shi‛ite Islamists assumed power there. Since then_ Shi‛a politics has played a dominant role in the development of both Iran and several other countries in the Middle East. This has included the restructuring of the political map in Iraq since the fall of the dictator Saddam Hussein_ which has meant that Shi‛ite political parties and leading Shi‛ite scribes play a decisive role in the politics of the country_ as well as the dominant role of Hizbollah in the Lebanon. Shi‛ite groups in a number of countries supporting a Sunni majority have also moved more to the fore. The development that has taken place in Shi‛a dominated areas over the last three decades is seen to be based on a Shi‛ite tradition of political ideas which has emerged during the 1400 year history of Shi‛a Islam. One feature of this development has been the predominant role of the scribes in politics_ and their regard for a tradition of political ideas which excludes any sharp distinction between the state/politics and religion. The question is whether this picture agrees with the view held by Shi‛ite thinkers regarding the relationship between the state and religion. A backward glance at Shi‛a history reveals that no shared view exists among Shi‛ite scholars on the subject of politics and this particular relationship. Seen from a history of ideas perspective_ it is not possible to speak about an unchanged metahistorical-political discourse which must have coloured all political thought throughout Shi‛a history. We find_ rather_ a broad spectrum of different views among Shi‛ite scholars_ whose most apparent feature has been that of being shaped and changed by way of interaction with social and political conditions in Shi‛a dominated regions. These views include revolutionary radicalism_ realpolitik thought and political quietism_ or abstinence. The differences between them can be found in the prevailing political and historical circumstances of long ago_ but the question is whether this model of explanation suffices for making clear why one group of Shi‛ite scholars should be drawn towards revolutionary radicalism while another sought out quietism - abstinence from politics - and yet another pursued realpolitik thought. Another question is whether_ aside from the influence of social_ historical and political structures and relations_ a closer look should also be taken at the importance of the tradition of theological interpretation. Did_ for example_ the view of the relationship between faith and reason play any part in this context?","Faith or Reason?"

As there is a lack of unity in choice of questionnaires and included measures concerning musculoskeletal disorders_ further investigations based on international recommendations are of interest. The intention of present study was to initiate the development of a clinically useful short-form questionnaire. The aim was to select items that capture prominent health aspects for women with neck-shoulder pain and thereby reduce the number of items to a clinically more convenient amount_ and to determine the underlying structure of included items.Method: Data were collected in a randomised controlled trial including women with non-specific neck-shoulder pain &gt; 3 months (n = 117). Data collection included three core domains: pain intensity_ physical and emotional functioning_ and analysis was performed using Principal component analysis_ and Varimax rotation.Results: The resulting 9-factor solution included interference_ solicitous/distracting responses_ mood and feelings about self and relations_ pain intensity_ punishing responses_ personal growth_ life control_ sleep_ and appetite (29 items).Conclusions: The results will contribute to the development of a reduced battery of questions representing core dimensions. Such questionnaire would lighten the assessment load in the clinic as well as in research.","An initial factor analysis of prominent aspects of health experiences for women with neck-shoulder pain"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu73622_7","This thesis is about the economic aspects of public procurement of services through auctionsin Sweden. It focuses on two different institutions_ auctions used to find foste r-parents forboarded out children in the 19th century_ and auctions of cleaning service contracts in the 20 thcentury. I n both cases_ the contracting entity is the municipality or its representative_ thelowest bidder wins the auction_ and is paid in accordance with his/her bid.In the child auctions_ c hildren were allotted to foster-parents by means of an open biddingprocess_ the descending English auction_ where the bids were given continuously to theauctioneer. In modern public procurement sealed bids ar e used in accordance with the firstprice_sealed bid auction. The first part of this thesis is about price formation in the childauctions and a study is made of the children who were auctioned several times_ indicatingasymmetric information among bidders or adverse selection in this market. These subjects arestudied using field data on 601 child auctions held in Northern Sweden during the period 1863to 1889. The empirical findings in the first paper suggest that the foster-parents had a cleareconomic motive in these auctions. The child characteristics significantly affect the amount ofcompensation paid to the foster-parent. There is also evidence that farmers preferred older_more productive children. The second paper studies whether a re-auctioned child commandeda higher or lower price than a child that was not re-auctioned. The results indicate some formof asymmetric information because foster-parents demanded a higher level of compensationfor a re-auctioned child. The results also suggest that the probability that a child was reauctionedincreased if he/she was not healthy.The third paper in the thesis discusses a kind of "paradox". Although there is a competitiveeffect on the bids in the auction of cleaning service contracts_ the contracting entity has anoption_ given by law_ to restrict the number of bidders. In th is paper_ an implementation costis introduced fo r the contracting entity to justify such a restriction. The results_ based onSwedish municipality data_ indicate that contract and municipality characteristics_ assumed toaffect the implementation cost_ affect the volume of the procurement_ and the number ofbidders_ but not necessarily the choice of allocation mechanism. The final paper studiesregional differences in bids_ costs_ and competition in municipal procurement using the samedata as in paper [3]. The results show higher estimated costs for completing the contract_ butlower estimated mean bids in the major city area of Stockholm compared with the res t of thecountry. This is explained by lower profit margins and higher operational costs in the majorcity area. An analysis is also carried out of why the lowest bidder is not always the contractedbidder.","Going once_ going twice_ SOLD!"

Results obtained for Fe1-cCrc demonstrate that the employed theoretical approach accurately describes the experimentally observed composition dependence of the polycrystalline elastic moduli of Fe-rich alloys encompassing maximum similar to 10% Cr. The elastic parameters of Fe-Cr alloys are found to exhibit anomalous composition dependence around 5% Cr. The immiscibility between Fe and Mg at ambient conditions is well reproduced by the present theory. The calculated lattice parameter for the Fe-Mg regular solid solution increases by similar to 1.95% when 10% Mg is introduced in Fe_ which corresponds approximately to 11% decrease in the average alloy density_ in perfect agreement with the experimental finding. At the same time_ we find that all of the elastic parameters of bcc Fe-Mg alloys decrease almost linearly with increasing Mg content. The present results show a much stronger alloying effect for Mg on the elastic properties of alpha-Fe than that for Cr.

However_ little attention has been devoted to exploring the factors regulating zebra mussel density and population size structure at the local scale. We tested effects of physicochemical factors and fish predation on the density of zebra mussels at several sites and between years in a natural lake. Water depth and roach (Rutilus rutilus) density were the most important variables affecting local zebra mussel density. Substrate was also an important factor but affected Dreissena density only at the shallowest depth examined (2 m)_ which also supported a large population of the mussels. Mean shell length of Dreissena increased with water depth. Our results indicate that predation pressure_ intraspecific competition_ and food limitation might be responsible for variation in zebra mussel density and population size structure in space and time and that fish predation might have strong top-down effects on zebra mussel populations.","Predation and physical environment structure the density and population size structure of zebra mussels"

A powder classification system based on sequential handling of compression parameters was applied. A single size fraction (90-125 mu m) of pectin powders with DM values ranging from 5-72% was studied. For DM 25%_ the effect of different particle size fractions (180-250_ 125-180_ 90-125_ 63-90_ 45-63_ &lt;45 mu m) were investigated. Compression parameters were derived based on time-resolved force-displacement data using Heckel_ Kawakita and Shapiro equations. Volume-specific surface area was estimated for powders and tablets. Tablet tensile strength was determined. It was found that all pectin powders displayed low degrees of particle rearrangement and relatively low degrees of fragmentation (class IIA materials). Pectin particles were found to be relatively soft_ with a tendency towards softer particles for pectins of higher DM. The overall variation in fragmentation and deformation behavior was limited. Both DM and initial particle size affected the tensile strength of pectin tablets. The difference in surface hydrophobicity caused by the DM was suggested as being responsible for the variation in the mechanical strengths. The study shows that pectin grades with DM &lt;= 40% are potential direct compression excipients.","Effect of degree of methoxylation and particle size on compression properties and compactibility of pectin powders"

The primary objective of the registry is to evaluate the acute and long-term safety of TLE; the secondary objective is to describe the characteristics of the patients_ the leads_ the indications for TLE_ and the tools and techniques currently used for TLE. About 100 centers will be enrolled on a voluntary basis from European countries; they are anonymous and stratified on the basis of their volume of activity into high-volume centers (&gt; 30 patients/year) and low-volume centers: (≤ 30 patients/year). Each participating center will have to enroll and follow up for 1 year consecutively assessed patients undergoing TLE from November 2012 to January 2014. The target is to achieve a sample size of at least 3_500 patients for statistical analysis. Data will be collected using a Web-based system and will be audited at randomly selected centers. The official start was on 6 November. Eighty-nine centers have joined so far_ 65 centers are currently active_ those who have already obtained the approval of their own ethics committee_ and 1_099 patients were enrolled at the end of June 2013.

There is thus a need for assessing accuracy of risk assessment methodologies. The aim of this study was to develop and examine a risk assessment guideline based on environmental assessment. The guideline examination was carried out along the railway and the road between Kiruna and Narvik_ Northern Scandinavia. The examined hazards were avalanches_ debris flows_ rock falls_ slush flows_ torrents_ moose and reindeer. Documented accidents were quantified into an accident level. For each hazard type_ six sections/sites were assessed. The propensities of these hazards were analysed through environmental assessments_ especially by utilising geomorphology. Then_ the accident densities along the sections/sites were compared with assessed accident phase indices describing risk and hazard in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The average uncertainty factors for both the risk and the hazard indices were about 5. This implies a fairly good precision. Risk and hazard indices were also rated and compared to the accident density rates. Thereafter_ railway and road information was split up as different proposal alternatives in an EIA context.

Thioredoxin expression is increased in several human primary cancers including lung_ colon_ cervix_ liver_ pancreatic_ colorectal and squamous cell cancer. The thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase pathway therefore provides an attractive target for cancer drug development.

Some of the newly prepared classes of tellurium-based inhibitors (lipid-like compounds 3b and 3e_ amino acid derivative 5b_ nucleic base derivative 8b_ and polyamine derivatives 14a and 14b) inhibited TrxR/Trx and cancer cell growth in culture with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range.","Thioredoxin Reductase and Cancer Cell Growth Inhibition by Organotellurium Compounds that could be Selectively Incorporated into Tumor Cells"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu7768_7","Computer simulations have emerged as a cost efficient complement to laboratory experiments_ as computers have become increasingly powerful.The aim of the present work is to explore the ideas of some state of the art software development practices_ and ways in which these can be useful for developing high performance research codes.The introduction of these practices_ and the modular designs that they give rise to_ raises issues regarding a potential conflict between runtime efficiency on one hand and development efficiency on the other. Flexible software modules_ based on mathematical abstractions_ will provide support for convenient implementation and modification of numerical operators. Questions still remain about whether such modules will provide the efficiency which is required for high performance applications.To answer these questions_ investigations were performed within two different problem domains. The first domain consisted of modular frameworks for the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations. Such frameworks proved a suitable setting_ since several of my research questions revolved around the issue of modularity.The second problem domain was that of symmetry exploiting algorithms. These algorithms are based on group theory_ and make ample use of mathematical abstractions from that field. The domain of symmetry exploiting algorithms gave us opportunities to investigate difficulties in combining modularity based on high level abstractions with low level optimizations using data layout and parallelization.In conclusion_ my investigation of software development practices for the area of high performance computing has proved very fruitful indeed. I have found that none of the concerns that were raised should lead us to refrain from the use of the practices that I have considered. On the contrary_ in the two case studies presented here_ these practices lead to designs that perform well in terms of usability as well as runtime efficiency.","Design of High Performance Computing Software for Genericity and Variability"

The present study therefore aims to describe the meaning of the conditions that enable a good life with BD. Ten persons_ six women and four men (aged 30 61)_ diagnosed with BD were interviewed. A reflective lifeworld perspective based on phenomenological philosophy was used. The findings present the essential meaning of the conditions that enable a good life with BD as a dependence that empowers_ which is further described by its constituents: ‘‘turning the course of life_’’ ‘‘protecting oneself from running out of energy_’’ ‘‘being needed_’’ ‘‘being oneself through reliable others_’’ ‘‘personal landmarks for navigating through life.’’ A voluntary chosen dependence_ as described in the present study_ is a new approach of care that enables a good life with BD_ while enhancing own power_ freedom_ and control. The conditions that enable a good life with BD are more than separate supporting measures.

Hence_ there is a need for individually adapted care that takes one's whole life situation into consideration.

METHODS: The Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) Validation Project identified_ as a subset of 614 TMD cases and 91 controls (n = 705)_ 309 subjects with concurrent TMD pain diagnoses (RDC/TMD) and temple headache. The temple headaches were subdivided into infrequent_ frequent_ and chronic headache according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders_ second edition (ICHD-II). Study variables included self-report measures of physical functioning (Jaw Function Limitation Scale [JFLS]_ Graded Chronic Pain Scale [GCPS]_ Short Form-12 [SF-12]) and emotional functioning (depression and anxiety as measured by the Symptom Checklist-90R/SCL-90R). Differences among the three headache subgroups were characterized by increasing headache frequency. The relationship between ordered headache frequency and physical as well as emotional functioning was analyzed using linear regression and trend tests for proportions. RESULTS: Physical functioning_ as assessed with the JFLS (P < .001)_ SF-12 (P < .001)_ and GCPS (P < .001)_ was significantly associated with increased headache frequency. Emotional functioning_ reflected in depression and anxiety_ was also associated with increased frequency of headache (both P < .001). CONCLUSION: Headache frequency was substantially correlated with reduced physical functioning and emotional functioning in subjects with TMD and concurrent temple headaches. A secondary finding was that headache was precipitated by jaw activities more often in subjects with more frequent temple headaches.","Influence of temple headache frequency on physical functioning and emotional functioning in subjects with temporomandibular disorder pain"

Postprandial lipid metabolism has been linked to CVD_ but little is known about the postprandial LDL-C profile in patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to study the postprandial levels of LDL-C in T2DM patients. Material and methods . After an overnight fast_ 74 T2DM patients_ mean age approximately 60 years_ were served a standard fat-rich meal of 3_515 kJ containing 54 % fat_ 13 % protein and 33 % carbohydrates. Only drinking water was allowed postprandially. Blood samples were drawn at times 0 (fasting)_ 1.5_ 3.0_ 4.5 and 6.0 h (postprandial). In all samples_ LDL-C was measured with modified beta quantification (separation by ultracentrifugation followed by measurement of infranate high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HLD-C) using a homogeneous assay). Results . At all postprandial times_ levels of LDL-C showed highly significant (p&lt;0.005) decreases compared to time 0 (mean 95 % CI maximum change in LDL-C levels at 3.0 h: -0.16 mmol/L -0.12; -0.20; p&lt;0.001). Independently of fasting LDL-C levels and ongoing statin therapy_ LDL-C decreased significantly more in female compared to male patients postprandially (mean 95 % CI maximum unadjusted change versus time 0 in LDL-C for men n=56 at 3.0 h: -0.14 mmol/L -0.19; -0.10_ p&lt;0.001; for women n=18 at 4.5 h: -0.26 mmol/L -0.35; -0.18_ p&lt;0.001; -0.14 mmol/L -0.24; -0.05_ p=0.005 between genders for the mean 95 % CI fasting adjusted difference at 4.5 h in the change versus time 0 in LDL-C; gender by time interaction: p=0.007 (repeated measures mixed model)). Conclusions . In T2DM patients served a fat-rich meal_ levels of LDL-C decreased significantly more in women compared to men postprandially_ irrespective of fasting levels or ongoing statin therapy. This might have implications in the atherosclerotic process and on any difference in the risk of CVD between genders.","Sustained postprandial decrease in plasma levels of LDL cholesterol in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1147703_7","BACKGROUND: Normal cell division is coordinated by a bipolar mitotic spindle_ ensuring symmetrical segregation of chromosomes. Cancer cells_ however_ occasionally divide into three or more directions. Such multipolar mitoses have been proposed to generate genetic diversity and thereby contribute to clonal evolution. However_ this notion has been little validated experimentally. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chromosome segregation and DNA content in daughter cells from multipolar mitoses were assessed by multiphoton cross sectioning and fluorescence in situ hybridization in cancer cells and non-neoplastic transformed cells. The DNA distribution resulting from multipolar cell division was found to be highly variable_ with frequent nullisomies in the daughter cells. Time-lapse imaging of H2B/GFP-labelled multipolar mitoses revealed that the time from the initiation of metaphase to the beginning of anaphase was prolonged and that the metaphase plates often switched polarity several times before metaphase-anaphase transition. The multipolar metaphase-anaphase transition was accompanied by a normal reduction of cellular cyclin B levels_ but typically occurred before completion of the normal separase activity cycle. Centromeric AURKB and MAD2 foci were observed frequently to remain on the centromeres of multipolar ana-telophase chromosomes_ indicating that multipolar mitoses were able to circumvent the spindle assembly checkpoint with some sister chromatids remaining unseparated after anaphase. Accordingly_ scoring the distribution of individual chromosomes in multipolar daughter nuclei revealed a high frequency of nondisjunction events_ resulting in a near-binomial allotment of sister chromatids to the daughter cells. CONCLUSION: The capability of multipolar mitoses to circumvent the spindle assembly checkpoint system typically results in a near-random distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. Spindle multipolarity could thus be a highly efficient generator of genetically diverse minority clones in transformed cell populations.","When the genome plays dice: circumvention of the spindle assembly checkpoint and near-random chromosome segregation in multipolar cancer cell mitoses."

Pitx1 mutants have a mild pituitary phenotype_ but Pitx2 is necessary for the development of Rathke&#39;s pouch_ expression of essential transcription factors in gonadotropes_ and expansion of the Pit1 lineage. We report that lack of Pitx2 causes the pouch to undergo excessive cell death_ resulting in severe pituitary hypoplasia. Transgenic overexpression of PITX2 in the pituitary can increase the gonadotrope population_ suggesting that the absolute concentration of PITX2 is important for normal pituitary cell lineage expansion. We show that PITX1 and PITX2 proteins are present in similar expression patterns throughout pituitary development and in the mature pituitary. Both transcription factors are preferentially expressed in adult gonadotropes and thyrotropes_ suggesting the possibility of overlap in maintenance of adult pituitary functions within these cell types. Double knockouts of Pitx1 and Pitx2 exhibit severe pituitary hypoplasia and fail to express the transcription factor LHX3. This indicates that these PITX genes are upstream of Lhx3 and have compensatory roles during development. Thus_ the combined dosage of these PITX family members is vital for pituitary development_ and their persistent coexpression in the adult pituitary suggests a continued role in maintenance of pituitary function.","PITX genes are required for cell survival and Lhx3 activation."

Mating was assortative in brehmii_ but not in collybita. Mixed matings were strongly asymmetric (excess of callybita male x brehmii female pairs)_ but did produce viable offspring in some cases. Sequence divergence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was 4.6%; Haplotypes segregated significantly with phenotype (only five &#39;mismatches&#39; among 94 individuals)_ demonstrating that mitochondrial gene flow was very restricted. The estimated proportion of F-1 hybrids in the reproductive population was significantly lower than expected under a closed population model_ indicating strong selection against hybrids. Genetic typing of 101 individuals at four microsatellite loci also showed significant population differentiation_ but nuclear gene flow was estimated to be 75 times higher than mitochondrial gene flow. This strong discrepancy is probably due to unisexual hybrid sterility (Haldane&#39;s rule).

Using path analysis and structural equation modeling_ we investigated how variation in the social environment affected clutch size and egg mass and two condition traits (postlaying mass_ immunological condition) and how these traits in turn affected female field survival. In the presence of many neighbors_ both morphs increased their clutch sizes_ although these effects were only significant in yellow females. In addition_ yellow females increased their egg mass in the presence of many orange neighbors. Orange females surrounded by many orange neighbors showed sign of stress in the form of immunosuppression_ whereas this effect was less pronounced in yellow females. The morphs also differed in the impact of variation in clutch size and egg mass on both condition traits. Finally_ female morphotype and immune responsiveness affected fitness interactively_ and hence these two traits showed signs of fitness epistasis: Selection gradients on this trait were opposite in sign in the two morphs. The correlational selection gradient (gamma (throatxantibody) (response)) between female throat color and antibody responsiveness was -0.365. Our data thus reveal important interactive effects such as genotype-by-environment interaction toward the social environment and morph-specific trade-offs as well as the occurrence of correlational selection.

The estimated number of bats killed per turbine annually was relatively low (0-3) on flat_ open farmland away from the coast_ higher (2-5) in more complex agricultural landscapes_ and highest (5-20) at the coast and on forested hills and ridges. The species killed almost exclusively (98%) belonged to a group (Nyctalus_ Pipistrellus_ Vespertilio and Eptesicus spp.) adapted for open-air foraging. The bats were killed by the moving rotor blades as they hunted insects attracted to the turbines. This occurred independently of sex and age. Peak mortality varied considerably in frequency and timing among years_ but the events usually (90%) occurred on nights with low wind speeds in late July to early October and to a lesser extent (10%) also in April-June. The mortality increased with turbine tower height and rotor diameter but was independent of the distance from the ground to the lowest rotor point. It was also independent of the size of the wind park (1-18 turbines). Bat species other than the open-air suite referred to above are usually not at risk at wind turbines_ because they fly below the rotors_ but are still killed occasionally (2%).","Bat mortality at wind turbines in northwestern Europe"

"oai_services_scigloo_org_178812_7","Efficient nitrogen removal at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is necessary to avoid eutrophication of recipient waters. The most commonly used approach consists of aerobic nitrification and subsequent anaerobic denitrification resulting in the release of dinitrogen gas into the atmosphere. Nitrification is a two-step process performed by ammoniaoxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) often grown in biofilms at WWTPs. An alternative approach is anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) where anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite directly into dinitrogen gas. These groups of bacteria grow very slowly and are sensitive to perturbations_ which may result in decreased efficiency or even breakdown of the process. Therefore_ the ecology and activity of these bacteria and the structure of the biofilms in which they grow require detailed investigation to improve the understanding of nitrification and to facilitate the design of efficient nitrogen-removal strategies. To facilitate such studies of relevance for wastewater treatment_ a nitrifying pilotplant was built where environmental conditions and especially ammonium concentrations could be controlled. In an experiment on model nitrifying trickling filters (NTFs)_ it was shown that biofilms subjected to intermittent feeding regimes of alternating high and low ammonium concentration in the water_ could maintain a higher nitrification potential than biofilms constantly fed with low ammonium water. Such ammonium feed strategies can be used to optimize wastewater treatment performance. Different AOB populations within the N. oligotropha lineage were shown to respond differently to changes in environmental conditions_ indicating microdiversity within this lineage which may be of importance for wastewater treatment. This diversity was further investigated through the development of new image analysis methods for analyzing bacterial spatial distribution in biofilms. The diversity within the N. oligotropha lineage was also reflected in the positioning of two such populations in the biofilm_ where the vertical distribution patterns and relative positions compared to the NOB Nitrospira were different. In combination with a cryosectioning approach for retrieval of intact biofilm from small biofilm carrier compartments_ the new image analysis methods showed a threedimensonal stratification of AOB-anammox biofilms. This may be of importance for mathematical modeling of such biofilms and the design of new biofilm carriers.","Biofilms in Nitrogen Removal - Bacterial Population Dynamics and Spatial Distribution"

The pattern is very flexible; this very flexibility makes it difficult to capture the pattern as anything more formal than prose_ pictures and prototypes. We show how to capture the essence of the VISITOR pattern as a reusable software library_ by using advanced type system features appearing in modern object-oriented languages such as Scala. We preserve type-safety statically and modularly: no reflection or similar mechanisms are used and modules can be independently compiled. The library is generic_ in two senses: not only is it parametrised by both the return type and the shape of the object hierarchy_ but also it allows a number of implementation choices (internal versus external control_ imperative versus functional behaviour_ orthogonal aspects such as tracing and memoisation) to be specified by parameters rather than fixed in early design decisions. Finally_ we propose a generalised datatype-like notation_on top of our visitor library: this provides a convenient functional decomposition style in object-oriented languages.","The visitor pattern as a reusable_ generic_ type-safe component"

"oai_services_scigloo_org_169591_7","This study aims at identifying the causes for deviations between actual and theoretical weld weight. Previous performed studies have shown examples of up to 40% extra weld consumables used in some cases. One consequence is of course higher production cost but it can also give increased weight leading to higher fuel consumption and decreased payload. An interesting aspect is that generous margins on specific production measures dilute important feedback of process variation information preventing and prolonging structural root cause analysis. The causes for the observed deviations can heritage from several areas_ both technical and within the information handling. The investigation shows that single components of the information structure and system_ such as unsuitable demands as well as incapable evaluation methods_ significantly influences the reliability of the entire manufacturing process. The common factor concerning when problems occur_ seems to be the ability of correct information transfer between different functions in the organisation preventing the mismatch to appear in the interface. Suggestions for improving this situation include cross functional agreements as well as new measuring methods.","The Influence of Correct Transfer of Weld Information on Production Cost"

Intracranial bleedings represents the most serious complication of TBI and need to be surgically evacuated promptly to save lives and mitigate injury. Microwave technology (MWT) is promising as a complement to computed tomography (CT) to be used in road and air ambulances for early detection of intracranial bleedings. In this study_ we perform numerical simulations to investigate if a classification algorithm based on singular value decomposition can distinguish between bleedings at different positions adjacent to the skull bone for a similar but simplified problem. The classification accuracy is 94-100% for all classes_ a result that encourages us to pursue our efforts with MWT for more realistic scenarios. This indicates that MWT has potential for localizing a detected bleeding_ which would increase the diagnostic value of this technique. © 2013 IEEE.","Microwave technology for localization of traumatic intracranial bleedings—a numerical simulation study"

We use DNA microarray technology to study the molecular mechanism of estrogen action in the heart and to identify novel estrogen-regulated genes. In this investigation we identify genes that are regulated by chronic estrogen treatment of mouse heart. We present our detailed characterization of one of these genes_ lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS). Northern and Western blot analysis revealed that L-PGDS was induced both by acute and chronic estrogen treatment. Northern blot analysis_ using estrogen receptor (ER)-disrupted mice_ suggests that L-PGDS is specifically induced by ERbeta in vivo. In further support of ERbeta-selective regulation_ we identify a functional estrogen-responsive element in the L-PGDS promoter_ the activity of which is up-regulated by ERbeta_ but not by ERalpha. We demonstrate that a one-nucleotide change (A to C) in the L-PGDS estrogen-responsive element affects receptor selectivity.","Specific regulation of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase in mouse heart by estrogen receptor beta."

For the decay of Li-11 the beta-delayed charged particle spectrum can be explained by the contribution of the 10.6 and 18.2 MeV states.

"oai_DiVA_org_fhs4260_7","The Instruction Centre for Operations on Law and Order Assurance (CIOpGLO) is a Brazilian Army facility created in March 2005 in Campinas_ Brazil. The mission of this centre involves the offering of training in different perspectives_ which includes the preparation of soldiers to enter in slums areas in Rio de Janeiro and other cities to arrest criminals_ whenever a federal intervention is required. This centre is involved in training to guarantee law and order and_ at the same time_ prepare officers and soldiers for interventions even in urban areas. To allow such training_ this facility counts with physical built sites to allow soldiers to train how to get inside houses_ how to shoot at short ranges (from 0 to 30 meters)_ how to move and shelter while going up in a hill with many houses and corridors on the way_ and so on. The Brazilian Army_ in the last few years_ started operating in slums like the ones of the "Alemão" and the "Penha" complex in Rio de Janeiro. The Army is also participating in operations out of Brazil in countries like Haiti. In situations like this_ the armed forces take over the coordination of public security temporarily to recover the control of certain areas. Since the armed forces were not originally created to act in situations like this_ there is a need to train all military stakeholders involved so that the operations are successful. Additionally_ major events like the Confederations Cup_ the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016_ generate additional demands for the armed forces_ which are likely to be called to act at specific times. Moreover_ it is noteworthy that there is a growing trend in which conflicts around the world occur_ more than ever_ inside the cities_ where civilians take great risk and suffer many casualties_ something called as “collateral damage” of the urban warfare. Recent examples include Afghanistan and Iraq. In this work_ the preparation of soldiers at CIOpGLO is discussed while the possibility of using new approaches based on augmented reality and mixed reality technologies are considered. As a way to enhance training and mission preparation with simulations_ this research focus on augmented reality (AR) supported by head-mounted displays (HMDs). HDMs may have many shapes_ which include pairs of glasses with lenses that present AR with superposed images_ enabling its wearer a total immersion in the simulation. The method used in this work involves a literature review on AR and HMDs_ assessment of training needs at the Brazilian Army and an evaluation of emerging technologies from the ICT sector. The technologies to be considered are the HDMs_ in this specific case the available programming languages_ software and hardware from suppliers of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and military off-the-shelf (MOTS). The main contribution of this work is the comparative study of the main solutions for HDM. This study represents an essential step for concept development and for the experimentation to exploit and evaluate the use of simulations. The research presented suggests that the approach is effective and that future work should be on both development of new applications and its evaluation in real training sets in Brazil.","Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality Technologies"

Firstly_ we wanted to establish the distribution of visual acuity (VA) and the prevalence of amblyopia and other ocular disorders in two population-based samples of 12-13-year-old children_ one that had been vision-screened at preschool age and the other that had not. Secondly_ we aimed to describe the ability of stereo tests to detect amblyopia and strabismus in a screening situation_ and thirdly_ to evaluate long-term visual outcome of treatment fo... merr amblyopia in a well-controlled group.Materials & Methods. Papers I - IV report on two field studies performed in Sweden and Mexico. Just over 1_000 12-13-year-old children from each country were included. A full eye examination was performed and children with pathology were referred to an eye clinic. The Swedish population had been vision-screened at preschool age. In Paper V_ 24 subjects were re-examined at a mean of 10.4 ± 1.9 years after cessation of the amblyopia treatment and the outcome of VA was evaluated.Results. In both the Swedish and the Mexican 12-13-year-olds_ visual status was found to be good. With the exception of amblyopia and astigmatism_ the overall results were surprisingly similar. The majority of subjects were found to have normal VA. Only one child had bilateral VA of =0.3. The prevalence of amblyopia (= 0.5) was 1.1% for Sweden and 2.5% for Mexico_ which is similar to that in other vision-screened and nonvision-screened populations. Myopia (= -0.5 D) was common in both populations (45% in the Swedish and 36% in the Mexican). Ocular albinism was found to be up to 100 times more prevalent than previously assumed. In a substantial number of children with bilateral subnormal VA (44%)_ we did not have a causal diagnosis.None of the five stereo tests we studied qualify as a screening test for amblyopia or strabismus due to large numbers of both underreferrals and overreferrals. The results for both ocularly normal subjects and subjects with strabismus and/or amblyopia were very varied. We conclude that there is no way of separating a normal response from a pathological response. Regarding visual outcome after amblyopia treatment_ VA was found to be stable in the amblyopic eye 10 years after cessation of treatment.","Amblyopia and subnormal visual acuity.

In Swedish municipality elections there are (as of 2014) no formal thresholds_ but the constituency sizes vary considerably. This note mainly presents the two mathematical formulas of interest for the calculation of effective thresholds. The voting share needed to get one seat under maximally charitable conditions (with respect to the distribution of votes among the other parties) is given by equation (7)_ where d is the first divisor (currently set to 1.4 in the Swedish system)_ M is the number of seats_ and n is the number of parties. The voting share needed to be guaranteed to have one seat is given by equation (13). There is a threshold in between these extremes_ a threshold at which there is a 50 % probability of winning one seat and a 50 % probability of winning none. For sufficiently large values of M_ it is reasonable to believe that equation (5) provides a good approximation for the 50 % probability threshold.","Om valkretsstorlekars spärreffekter"

The absorption spectrum of the N945H sensitizer is dominated by metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions in the visible region_ with the lowest allowed MLCT bands appearing at 25 380 and 18 180 cm(-1).

An INDO/S and density functional theory study of the electronic and optical properties of N945H and of N945 adsorbed on TiO2 was performed. The calculations point out that the top three frontier-filled orbitals have essentially ruthenium 4d (t(2g) in the octahedral group) character with sizable contribution coming from the NCS ligand orbitals.

Our aim was to elucidate mechanisms for transcriptional shutdown of MAT genes during late maturation_ to better understand phase transition between MAT and LEA stages. Using transgenic and transient approaches in Nicotiana_ we examined activities of two ABI3-dependent reporter genes driven by multimeric RY and abscisic acid response elements (ABREs) from a Brassica napus napin gene_ termed RY and ABRE_ where the RY reporter requires ABI3 DNA binding. Expression of RY peaks during mid-maturation and drops during late maturation_ mimicking the MAT gene program_ and in Arabidopsis thaliana RY elements are over-represented in MAT_ but not in LEA_ genes. The ABI3 transactivation of RY is inhibited by staurosporine_ by a PP2C phosphatase_ and by a repressor of maturation genes_ VAL1/HSI2. The RY element mediates repression of MAT genes_ and we propose that transcriptional shutdown of the MAT program during late maturation involves inhibition of ABI3 DNA binding by dephosphorylation. Later_ during seedling growth_ VAL1/HSI2 family repressors silence MAT genes by binding RY elements.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth122_7","The aim of this thesis is to increase the understanding of wear in rolling/sliding contacts such as the wheel-rail contact for railroads and the roller-washer contact for roller bearings.The Stockholm commuter train network has been the subject of papers A and B in this thesis in which the wear and surface cracks on rails has been observed for a period of three years. By comparing the wear depth with the crack length_ equilibrium between these two damage mechanisms was found for a lubricated rail. By using a lubricant with friction modifiers the stresses was low enough to prevent crack propagation; at the same time_ the rail was hard enough to reduce the wear rate. This is probably the most favourable state in terms of rail maintenance cost.Roller bearings subjected to lubricant borne particles have been the subject of papers C_ D and E in this thesis. Particles in the lubricating oil can have a significant impact on the wear in lubricated contacts. Even at low concentration levels can self-generated particles cause significant wear. The here presented results shows that filtration during run-in can significantly reduce both the mass loss and the number of self generated particles. A series of experiments has been carried out to study the wear of roller bearings by ingested lubricant borne hard particles. The form of the worn profile and the length of wear scratches correspond closely to the sliding within the contact. A count of the number of wear scratches on the rolling element surface indicates that the contact concentrates particles. A novel wear model based on the observation of a single point on the contacting surface when a concentration of particles passes through it has been developed and the necessary data for the model has been determined from the experiments. Comparison of the simulation results with the experimental results shows good qualitative agreement for the form change of the washer surfaces.","On wear in rolling/sliding contacts"

In fact_ product development has acquired an ever more central role in the strategic planning of companies_ and it has extended its influence to R&amp;D funding levels as well. It is not surprising that many national R&amp;D project frameworks within the EU today are dominated by product development topics_ leaving production engineering_ robotics_ and systems on the sidelines. The reasons may be many but_ unfortunately_ the link between product development and the production processes they cater for are seldom treated in depth. The issue dealt with in this article relates to how product development is applied in order to attain the required production quality levels a company may desire_ as well as how one may counter assembly defects and deviations through quantifiable design approaches.It is recognized that product verifications (tests_ inspections_ etc.) are necessary_ but the application of these tactics often result in lead-time extensions and increased costs. Modular architectures improve this by simplifying the verification of the assembled product at module level. Furthermore_ since Design for Assembly (DFA) has shown the possibility to identify defective assemblies_ it may be possible to detect potential assembly defects already in the product and module design phase. The intention of this paper is to discuss and describe the link between verifications of modular architectures_ defects and design for assembly.

By connecting submodule circuits in series_ a high-voltage waveform with excellent harmonic performance can be achieved with a very high efficiency and low switching frequency. The balancing of the capacitor voltages will_ however_ become increasingly difficult as the switching frequency is reduced. Although the capacitor voltages can be kept balanced over time even at the fundamental switching frequency_ the spread and thus also the peak variation in the capacitor voltages will typically increase at lower switching frequencies. This paper presents a capacitor voltage balancing strategy which aims to combine a low switching frequency with a low capacitor voltage ripple. This is done by a predictive algorithm that calculates the amount of charge that must be stored in the submodule capacitors during the following fundamental frequency period. The converter is then controlled in such a way that the stored charge in the submodule capacitors is evenly distributed among all the submodules when the capacitor voltages reach their maximum values. In this way_ it is possible to limit the peak voltage in the capacitor at switching frequencies as low as 2-3 times the fundamental frequency. The capacitor voltage balancing strategy is first validated by simulation results at 110 Hz switching frequency. It is observeved that when the proposed method is used_ the capacitor voltage ripple is 35% lower compared to the case when a conventional sorting algorithm is used. The capacitor voltage balancing strategy is also validated experimentally at 130 Hz switching frequency. The experimental results show that it is possible to combine the proposed method with previously presented circulating-current control methods.","Predictive sorting algorithm for modular multilevel converters minimizing the spread in the submodule capacitor voltages"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth134579_7","In indoor or urban applications_ a moving robot with wireless communications will experience multipath fading. This causes rapid signal strength variations due to interfering reflections of the radio signal. By making short stops at positions with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)_ the robot can trade trajectory tracking accuracy for increased link quality. This represents a type of opportunistic communication-aware motion planning. We propose two novel strategies for improving the link capacity or throughput when either the robot has full knowledge of how the SNR varies along the trajectory_ or when only the SNR distribution is known or can be estimated. In the latter case_ this leads to an optimal stopping problem over a finite horizon. Both cases are analyzed for independent as well as correlated SNR samples_ and a bounded maximum trajectory tracking error. We derive the resulting SNR distributions for the proposed strategies and use them to show how the expected capacity and throughput vary with the allowed tracking error. The results are confirmed by simulations and experiments. Experiments in six different locations validate the communication model and show that the proposed motion planning is robust to non-static fading and can yield throughput improvements of more than 100%.","Exploiting multipath fading with a mobile robot"

The second was aimed at measuring the effects or impact of the risk communication programme on the public. A total of 346 respondents participated in the study by answering two questionnaires. An evaluation of the risk communication efforts was focused around three dimensions: comprehension_ audience evaluation and communication failures. The results showed differences between the two campaigns that gave significantly different results in the two communities.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of an early interventional strategy in different risk groups from a UK health-service perspective. Design: Decision-analytic model based on randomised clinical trial data. Main outcome measures: Costs in UK Sterling at 2003/2004 prices and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) combined into an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Methods: Data from the third Randomised Intervention Trial of unstable Angina (RITA 3) was employed to estimate rates of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction_ costs and health-related quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was estimated over patients’ lifetimes within the decision-analytic model. Results: The mean incremental cost per QALY gained for an early interventional strategy was approximately £55 000_ £22 000 and £12 000 for patients at low_ intermediate and high risk_ respectively. The early interventional strategy is approximately 1%_ 35% and 95% likely to be cost-effective for patients at low_ intermediate and high risk_ respectively_ at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of early intervention in low-risk patients is sensitive to assumptions about the duration of the treatment effect. Conclusion: An early interventional strategy in patients presenting with NSTE-ACS is likely to be considered cost-effective for patients at high and intermediate risk_ but this is less likely to be the case for patients at low risk.","The cost-effectiveness of an early interventional strategy in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome based on the RITA 3 trial"

It is shown that efficient spin alignment can be achieved in a diluted magnetic semiconductor barrier (a layer of ZnMnSe or ZnMnSe/CdSe superlattice) as thin as 10 nm. Rather efficient spin injection from such a thin spin aligner to a non-magnetic quantum well is demonstrated_ even when the tunneling energy barrier is as thick as 10 nm.

The aim of this study was to determine how the mixing of two susceptible genomes might influence expression of idiopathic and induced autoimmunity over a period of 14 mo of exposure to mercury and silver. Spontaneous autoimmunity first appeared as antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in females at 10 wk of age and in males at 10 mo of age_ and was followed by development of anti-chromatin antibodies. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA developed in 60% of males and 20% of females. Thirty percent of males and 10% of females developed a coarsely speckled ANA pattern associated with high titers of anti-Sm antibodies. Glomerular immune complex (IC) deposits and a proliferative glomerulonephritis were seen at 17 mo of age. The F1 hybrids treated with metals showed no exaggeration of spontaneous autoimmunity. However_ the metals suppressed the spontaneous development of anti-Sm and antichromatin antibodies. The metal-induced AFA_ linked to the H-2s and H-2q haplotype_ reached a maximum after 3-4 mo of treatment and then declined_ 33% of the silver-treated hybrids finally became AFA-negative_ despite continuous treatment. The decline in ANoA during metal treatment is contrary to the situation in metal-treated SJL mice. This indicates that dominant SWR background genes suppressed induction of certain autoimmune traits in the (SWR x SJL)F1 hybrid mice.

Therefore logistics service providers have a possibility to compete by being greener than their competitors. One possibility is to offer services that include different green aspects. The purpose of this paper is to develop a description of possible green categories of a logistics offering_ based on a combination of customer and logistics service provider perspectives.Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review showed what has been published on offerings and requirements regarding green logistics. Empirical data was collected in two steps. A survey was sent out to both shippers and logistics service providers and selected company homepages were scanned.Findings: The paper identifies a range of green categories as well as more specific aspects that can be a part of logistics service providers’ offerings. The findings consist of views from shippers as well as logistics service providers.Research limitations/implications (if applicable): The paper is mainly based on Swedish companies only and thereby provides a possibility to extend the research into other countries as well. Specific research on logistics companies’ green offerings is still scarce and a multidisciplinary approach is recommended for future research.Practical implications (if applicable): The paper provides insight into which green aspects logistics service providers can include in their offerings_ as well as what customers could demand from logistics service providers.What is original/value of paper: This paper illustrates both theoretically and empirically which green aspects that can be included in offerings and thereby providing logistics service providers with increased competitiveness alongside increased sustainability.","Greening the offerings of logistics service providers"

As a result of the introduction of penalties on carbondioxide emissions and other economic instruments_ the energy industry is striving to improve energyefficiency and climate mitigation by switching from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. Biomass-based combinedheat and power (CHP) plants connected to district heating networks have a need to find uses for theexcess heat they produce in summer when the heat demand is low. On the other hand_ the transport sectormakes a substantial contribution to the increasing CO2emissions_ which have to be reduced. Onepromising alternative to address these challenging issues is the integration of vehicle fuel productionwith biomass-based CHP plants. This paper presents the configuration and operating profits in termsof electricity_ heat and ethanol fuel from cellulosic biomass. A case study of a commercial small scaleCHP plant was conducted using simulation and modeling tools. The results clearly show that electricityproduction can be increased when CHP production is integrated with cellulosic ethanol production. Thefindings also show that the economic benefits of the energy system can be realized with near-term commerciallyavailable technology_ and that the benefits do not rely solely on ethanol yields.","The impact of lignocellulosic ethanol yields in polygeneration with district heating"

"oai_DiVA_org_miun4143_7","Marginal resources are important for organizers of public events. In the present context_ marginal resources are defined as resources that providers can offer to events in periods when these resources cannot be put to productive use in their regular operations. Such marginal resources are often mobilized through networks of social relationships when the resource providers regard a connection to the public event as being valuable. The mobilization of marginal resources is analyzed using a network approach and by analyzing the motives of the participating resource providers. Cases involving two public events are presented in order to illustrate the mobilization and the development of patterns and routines over time. The cases indicate that resources are mainly mobilized through networking. Building and using the legitimacy of the event are important factors in this process. The actors providing resources are motivated by a mix of interests_ but most of them have an idealistic interest in the event. The mobilized resources are combined in ways that create economy of scope and scale for the organizer.

"oai_DiVA_org_su15155_7","Durant the last decenniums war and conflicts between nations have decreased substantially. Conflicts and civil wars within nations have instead increased_ and with those the huge amount of internal displaced persons or internal refugees. A big proportion of the combatants in these wars are men_ while women constitute the majority of survivors becoming in turn the main carers and bearers of the poverty and devastation that wars and internal conflicts generate. This paper aims to introduce a discussion on what this “new world” looks like pertaining this feminization of migration. The core question is to elucidate what challenges emerge at local places in this era of global female displacement for paraphrasing “The Age of migration” advanced by Castles and Miller (2003_ Palgrave). The Age of female displacement emerges in a interconnected world that make international migration and its challenges more visible. Nevertheless_ a problem is that as internationalization is at the core of the debate it hides the realities related to the local societies directly affected by the conflicts. Although transnational migrants achieve attention in the processes of discrimination_ segregation and racism in more urbanised countries_ the same attention to internal displaced persons become uncovered. This particularities on the debate on international migration generate a set of dichotomies like those along lines of regional and international migrants_ political and economic migrants_ rural and urban destinations_ rich and poor nations_ and so for. As such these dichotomies are at the core of a methodological nationalism that needs to be contested in order to see the extended complexity attached to migratory processes. This task can be conducted in two directions. At the first places by advancing a discussion on the pros and cons of cosmopolite methodologies that try to overcome nationalism. At the second place by applying an intersectionality approach to the different phenomena involved in the migratory process.The paper will lay ground for an interconnection of experiences related to feminized displacement and segregation at two local places that methodological nationalisms may well try to keep apart from each other. The first place is located in Colombia_ and the other in Sweden. The paper try to introduce an analysis about how people are working with gendered planning in these multicultural milieus that have emerged from the intensive resettlement of displaced persons. The attempt can inform on complementary perspectives on gender mainstreaming that inform both societies on how to deal with the feminization of migration_ discrimination and segregation.","The Age of Female Displacement:"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu102494_7","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton beam therapy offers potential clinical advantages compared with conventional radiation therapy for many cancer patients. The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation_ mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs_ compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67_000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would_ however_ be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter.

"oai_DiVA_org_uu103369_7","BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested that increased blood pressure has a stronger effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in lean persons than in obese persons_ although this is not a universal finding. Given the inconsistency of this result_ we tested it using a large population-based cohort data set. METHODS AND RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) and body mass index were measured in 1 145 758 Swedish men born between 1951 and 1976 who were in young adulthood (median age 18.2 years). During the register-based follow-up_ which lasted until the end of 2006_ 65 611 new CVD events took place_ including 6799 myocardial infarctions and 8827 strokes. Hazard ratios (HRs) per 1-SD increase in systolic and diastolic BP were computed within established body mass index categories (underweight_ normal_ overweight_ or obese) with Cox proportional hazards models. The strongest associations of diastolic BP with CVD (HR 1.18)_ myocardial infarction (HR 1.22)_ and stroke (HR 1.13) were observed in the obese category. For systolic BP_ the strongest associations were observed in the obese category with CVD (HR 1.16) and stroke (HR 1.29) but in the overweight category with myocardial infarction (HR 1.19). We observed statistically significant interactions (P&lt;0.0001) with body mass index for diastolic BP in relation to CVD and for systolic BP in relation to CVD and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the findings of previous studies_ we observed a general increase in the magnitude of the association between blood pressure and subsequent CVD with increasing body mass index. Hypertension should not be regarded as a less serious risk factor in obese than in lean or normal-weight persons.","Does obesity modify the effect of blood pressure on the risk of cardiovascular disease?"

Nitrocefin discs were used for beta-lactamase detection. RESULTS: All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. During 2005 and 2006_ however_ 5%_ 50%_ 70% and 77% displayed intermediate susceptibility or resistance to spectinomycin_ ciprofloxacin_ tetracycline and penicillin G_ respectively. Furthermore_ 4% of the isolates were beta-lactamase producing during these years. The different federal districts of Russia displayed substantial heterogeneities with regard to the prevalence of gonorrhoea and antimicrobial resistance among N gonorrhoeae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: In Russia_ penicillins_ ciprofloxacin_ or tetracycline should definitively not be used in the empirical treatment of gonorrhoea. The recommended first-line antimicrobial drug should be ceftriaxone. If ceftriaxone is not available_ spectinomycin ought to be used.

"oai_DiVA_org_uu150714_7","Temperature alone can explain a great amount of variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) mineralization. Studies on decomposition of soil OC suggest that the temperature sensitivity is different for the decomposition of labile and recalcitrant OC_ but lake sediments with different contributions of labile and recalcitrant components have been reported to show similar temperature sensitivities. Sediment mineralization is typically measured in short-term incubations. However_ whether the mineralization of OC in sediments dominated by recalcitrant and labile OC have different temperature sensitivities at the longer term is not clear. Here we show that during 5 months of continuous incubation of contrasting boreal lake sediments_ sediment mineralization was strongly dependent on temperature and OC quality/origin but temperature sensitivity was similar across lakes and over time. Sediment mineralization showed low overall rates in spite of low apparent activation energy (Ea) compared to published rates of soil and litter mineralization. The fraction of the total OC pool that was lost during 5 months varied between 0.4 and 14%. The non-buried sediment OC pool was lost slowly_ with apparent turnover times between 2.5 and 32 years.

Thus_ intriguing questions are raised about the morphological and functional organization of neuronal systems endowed with such a dual signalling capacity.

Its efficacy and safety has been discussed extensively and several techniques of lipoinjection have been developed. However_ one is bound to overcorrect by 30%-70% or need to repeat the procedure because of resorption of the transplant. The reasons are that many of the transplanted cells are already differentiated_ and also that there is no nutritional support to the inner cell layers when they are transplanted as fragments. By culturing autologous adipocytes one can ensure that only non-differentiated_ but committed_ preadipocytes are transplanted and the procedure can be done in a way that ensures optimal nutritional support for the cells. In the present study we have compared our cell culture technique with two common clinical ways of processing liposuction material and found that (pre)adipocytes survive and proliferate significantly better in cell culture.","Adipose tissue processed for lipoinjection shows increased cellular survival in vitro when tissue engineering principles are applied."
"oai_DiVA_org_uu152644_7","Genetic and morphological similarity between populations separated by large distances may be caused by frequent long-distance dispersal or retained ancestral polymorphism. The frequent lack of differentiation between disjunct conspecific moss populations on different continents has traditionally been explained by the latter model_ and has been cited as evidence that many or most moss species are extremely ancient and slowly diverging. We have studied intercontinental differentiation in the amphi-Atlantic peat moss Sphagnum angermanicum using 23 microsatellite markers. Two major genetic clusters are found_ both of which occur throughout the distributional range. Patterns of genetic structuring and overall migration patterns suggest that the species probably originated in North America_ and seems to have been established twice in Northern Europe during the past 40_000 years. We conclude that similarity between S. angermanicum populations on different continents is not the result of ancient vicariance and subsequent stasis. Rather_ the observed pattern can be explained by multiple long-distance dispersal over limited evolutionary time. The genetic similarity can also partly be explained by incomplete lineage sorting_ but this appears to be caused by the short time since separation. Our study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that Sphagnum_ constituting a significant part of northern hemisphere biodiversity_ may be more evolutionary dynamic than previously assumed.","North american origin and recent European establishments of the amphi-atlantic peat moss sphagnum angermanicum"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu157144_7","Character displacement can reduce costly interspecific interactions between young species. We investigated the mechanisms behind divergence in three key traits—breeding habitat choice_ timing of breeding_ and plumage coloration—in Ficedula flycatchers. We found that male pied flycatchers became expelled from the preferred deciduous habitat into mixed forest as the superior competitor_ collared flycatchers_ increased in numbers. The peak in food abundance differs between habitats_ and the spatial segregation was paralleled by an increased divergence in timing of breeding between the two species. Male pied flycatchers vary from brown to black with brown coloration being more frequent in sympatry with collared flycatchers_ a pattern often proposed to result from selection against hybridization_ that is_ reinforcement. In contrast to this view_ we show that brown male pied flycatchers more often hybridize than black males. Male pied flycatcher plumage coloration influenced the territory obtained in areas of co-occurrence with collared flycatchers_ and brown male pied flycatchers experienced higher relative fitness than black males when faced with heterospecific competition. We suggest that allopatric divergence in resource defense ability causes a feedback loop at secondary contact where male pied flycatchers with the most divergent strategy compared to collared flycatchers are favored by selection.","Positive feedback between ecological and reproductive character displacement in a young avian hybrid zone"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu17228_7","The blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) in choroid plexus works with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in cerebral capillaries to stabilize the fluid environment of neurons. Dysfunction of either transport interface_ i.e._ BCSFB or BBB_ causes augmented fluxes of ions_ water and proteins into the CNS. These barrier disruptions lead to problems with edema and other compromised homeostatic mechanisms. Hyperthermic effects on BCSFB permeability and transport are not as well known as for BBB. However_ it is becoming increasingly appreciated that elevated prostaglandin synthesis from fever/heat activation of cyclooxygenases (COXs) in the BCSFB promotes water and ion transfer from plasma to the ventricles; this harmful fluid movement into the CSF-brain interior can be attenuated by agents that inhibit the COXs. Moreover_ new functional data from our laboratory animal model indicate that the BCSFB (choroidal epithelium) and the CSF-bordering ependymal cells are vulnerable to whole body hyperthermia (WBH). This is evidenced from the fact that rats subjected to 4h of heat stress (38 degrees C) showed a significant increase in the translocation of Evans blue and (131)Iodine from plasma to cisternal CSF_ and manifested blue staining of the dorsal surface of the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Degeneration of choroidal epithelial cells and underlying ependyma_ a dilated ventricular space and damage to the underlying neuropil were frequent. A disrupted BCSFB is associated with a marked increase in edema formation in the hippocampus_ caudate nucleus_ thalamus and hypothalamus. Taken together_ these findings suggest that the breaching of the BCSFB in hyperthermia significantly contributes to cell and tissue injuries in the CNS.","Blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in hyperthermia"

In this article_ I examine if there is a link between experiences of discrimination and the choice of elite education. The study is based upon semi-structured interviews with five female and five male law students of Middle Eastern background. The findings show that discrimination_ either against the students or their parents_ has led to a high study motivation where the choice of elite education can be understood as an anti-discrimination strategy. Other anti-discrimination strategies are to resist a victim mentality and to destigmatize by challenging stereotypes. These anti-discrimination strategies can be understood as strategies for recognition_ that is_ striving for equality by being ascribed a positive status.","Elitutbildning: en strategi för erkännande?"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu198049_7","Abdominal surgery inhibits gastrointestinal motility_ a phenomenon referred to as postoperative ileus. Since the postoperative ileus disturbs duodenal physiology it is important to minimize the side effects of this condition. Recent experiments in our laboratory show that treatment of anaesthetised rats with parecoxib_ a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor_ prevents duodenal postoperative ileus_ increases duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion and improves other functions as well. One aim of the thesis was to investigate whether removal of luminal chloride affect the parecoxib- and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced stimulation of duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion. The proximal duodenum of anaesthetised Dark Agouti rats was perfused with isotonic solutions containing zero or low Cl- and the effect on luminal alkalinisation determined. The basal as well as the parecoxib-induced increase in alkalinisation_ but not that stimulated by VIP_ were markedly reduced in the absence of luminal Cl-.One important function of the duodenum is to adjust luminal osmolality towards that in the blood. It is believed that the adjustment of osmolality in the duodenum is achieved by osmosis and diffusion of electrolytes along their concentration gradients and that these processes occur predominately paracellularly. Another aim of the thesis was to examine whether prevention of postoperative ileus affects the duodenal response to luminal hypertonicity. The proximal duodenum of anaesthetised Dark Agouti and Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with hypertonic solutions of different composition and osmolality and the effects on duodenal motility_ alkaline secretion_ transepithelial fluid flux_ mucosal permeability and the adjustment of luminal osmolality were determined in absence and presence of parecoxib.It is concluded that COX-2 inhibition increases duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion by stimulating apical Cl-/HCO3- exchange in duodenocytes. Furthermore_ pretreatment of anaesthetised rats with parecoxib improves a number of duodenal functions in both rat strains that contribute to improve the ability to adjust luminal osmolality. The choice of rat strain is another important feature to consider when interpreting the results because the DA strain was more responsive to luminal hypertonicity than the SD strain. Finally_ several evidences are provided to suggest that the adjustment of luminal osmolality in the rat duodenum is a regulated process. ","Prevention of Postoperative Duodenal Ileus by COX-2 Inhibition Improves Duodenal Function in Anaesthetised Rats"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu182547_7","We present the study of the electric field changes generated by the preliminary breakdown for negative cloud-to-ground lightning flashes in Malaysia and Sweden concerning the association of slow field changes associated in preliminary breakdown process. We examined the total of 1685 negative cloud-to-ground lightning flashes from the total of 39 thunderstorms by recording the slow electric field_ fast electric field and narrowband radiation field at 3 and 30 MHz signals simultaneously. Our results show that there is a pre-starting time_ i.e. the duration between the first preliminary breakdown pulse and slow field changes starting point_ which is found to be after the first preliminary breakdown pulse. The pre-starting time has the arithmetic and geometric mean range from 1.4-6.47 and 1-3.36 ms_ respectively. The mean values of pre-starting time in Malaysia are greater than the values observed in Sweden by more than a factor of 3. From the two data sets it shows that the slow field changes never start before the preliminary breakdown. Furthermore_ the use of single-station electric fields measurement with high resolutions of 12 bits transient recorder with several nanosecond accuracy allow one to distinguish the slow field changes generated by preliminary breakdown_ which preceded the negative first return stroke_ between tens to hundreds of milliseconds of pre-return stroke duration.","Electric field changes generated by the preliminary breakdown for the negative cloud-to-ground lightning flashes in Malaysia and Sweden"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu201818_7","The transformation of normal cells to malignant_ metastatic tumor cells is a multistep process caused by the sequential acquirement of genetic changes. To identify these changes_ we compared the transcriptomes and levels and distribution of proteins in a four-stage cell model of isogenically matched normal_ immortalized_ transformed_ and metastatic human cells_ using deep transcriptome sequencing and immunofluorescence microscopy. The data show that similar to 6% (n = 1_357) of the human protein-coding genes are differentially expressed across the stages in the model. Interestingly_ the majority of these genes are down-regulated_ linking malignant transformation to dedifferentiation. The up-regulated genes are mainly components that control cellular proliferation_ whereas the down-regulated genes consist of proteins exposed on or secreted from the cell surface. As many of the identified gene products control basic cellular functions that are defective in cancers_ the data provide candidates for follow-up studies to investigate their functional roles in tumor formation. When we further compared the expression levels of four of the identified proteins in clinical cancer cohorts_ similar differences were observed between benign and cancer cells_ as in the cell model. This shows that this comprehensive demonstration of the molecular changes underlying malignant transformation is a relevant model to study the process of tumor formation.","Majority of differentially expressed genes are down-regulated during malignant transformation in a four-stage model"

This thesis work has focused on molecular mechanisms of altered growth control in glioma_ and the significance of two gene products belonging to pathways commonly affected in glioma_ p16INK4a and PDGF-B_ has been investigated in vitro and in vivo.The INK4a locus is one of the most frequently lossed tumor suppressor gene of human gliomas. It encodes a G1 specific cell cycle inhibitor_ p16INK4a_ which was ectopically expressed in the human malignant glioma cell line U-1242 MG. Forced expression caused a G1 arrest and senescence in the cells_ defined by an inability to induce DNA replication at subconfluency in the presence of serum_ an enlarged cell morphology and expression of a senescence marker_ senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal).Many studies have implicated a role for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in human glioma. We established a mouse brain tumor model by injecting a murine retrovirus containing the PDGP-B cDNA together with wild-type virus_ intracranially in neonatal mice. The induced malignant brain tumors displayed features of human gliomas. Tumor cells were nestin positive and expressed PDGP-B and PDGF-Rα mRNA_ suggesting an autocrine stimulation of a neuroepithelial progenitor cell as the mechanism of tumor induction. A cell line was established from one PDGF-B induced tumor. Cultured tumor cells expressed PDGF-B causing autophosphorylation of endogenous PDGF receptors. A specific PDGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor caused a striking inhibition of PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation_ showing a dependence of PDGF stimulation in initiation as well as progression of these tumors. Furthermore_ the contribution of insertional mutagenesis in tumor development was analysed. Retroviral insertions in genomic DNA from 15 tumors were investigated with inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) and sequencing. Preliminary data indicate the presence of a common integration site in a sequence mapped to a defined region of human chromosome 22_ corresponding to mouse chromosome 15.","Roles of p16INk a and PDGF-B in glioma"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu676_7","Extrusion is a common method to manufacture long products of aluminium_ such as beams_ rods and tubes. The aim of this thesis was to improve the material in the die bearing surface_ and thereby the service life of extrusion dies through wear studies of actual dies_ and experimental simulations. Field tests showed that a die bearing is initially worn through delamination of the surface layer followed by chemical degradation and subsequent mechanical removal of the tool steel by the hot aluminium. An experimental test based on a block-on-ring configuration has been developed with the ability to reproduce the tribological conditions on the die bearing_ including wear mechanisms_ wear rate and the influence of process parameters typical for extrusion. It was shown by experimental simulation that nitriding has the potential to increase the service life of tool steel with almost one order of magnitude. The iron nitrides protects the steel from chemical degradation_ and thereby reduces wear. Especially_ the presence of a homogenous compound layer is beneficial for the wear resistance. Furthermore_ physically vapour deposited (PVD) coatings of CrN_ (Ti_A1)N and TiB2 have the potential to increase the wear resistance significantly_ as compared to nitrided steel. They combine a superior mechanical strength with high chemical and thermal resistance against hot aluminum. The wear rate of nitrided steel was found to decrease at lower extrudate temperatures_ and at relatively long stop times_ associated to the recurrent insertion of new billets during extrusion. Finally_ experimental simulation of extrusion was used to develop a model for prediction of the wear resistance of the tool_ taking into consideration the individual contributions from the tool steel_ nitrided layer and PVD coating.","Tribological aspects of aluminium extrusion dies"

Specific and national management guidelines for pediatric head injuries are lacking in Sweden_ and management routines are consequently based on adult guidelines or local guidelines. The objectives of this thesis were to investigate the current management of pediatric head injury in Sweden and to explore the possibility of introducing a brain injury marker_ protein S100B_ for optimizing pediatric head injury management. Paper I_ a survey in 51 Swedish hospitals_ shows that the management routines vary from hospital to hospital_ especially concerning criteria for computed tomography_ admission_ and discharge. The children are initially managed by general surgeons and pediatricians_ although several other departments are involved after the admission of the child. Less than one third of the hospitals reported the use of a standardized observation scheme. The study concludes the urgent need for standardized and updated routines for pediatric head injury management. Paper II shows that children admitted to a neurosurgical unit after head injury do well. However_ pediatric head injury management based solely on adult guidelines_ loss of consciousness or amnesia is not reliable_ since there is a non-negligible risk of missing a clinically relevant intracranial hematoma. Before a serum marker can be properly evaluated in clinical trials_ there is a need for knowing the reference levels of the marker. Capillary sampling in young children is sometimes easier and less painful and time consuming than venous sampling. In Paper III simultaneous capillary_ venous and arterial samples were drawn and compared. The results show that analysis of capillary S100B is possible_ but differ from venous concentrations by an average of 0.08 µg/L_ while arterial and venous samples can be considered nearly equal. Hence_ separate reference levels for capillary and venous S100B are required. Paper IV therefore investigates both capillary and venous reference values for S100B in 465 neurologically healthy children. Pediatric S100B reference levels are age-related and higher than those set for adults (venous S100B: 0.14 µg/L for 3-16 year old vs. 0.10 µg/L for adults)_ while capillary S100B for 3-16 year old is 0.40 µg/L. These reference levels should be used in the evaluation of future studies.","Clinical Aspects of Pediatric Head Injury"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1895424_7","En av de största orsakerna till svårt handikapp och död i västvärlden är traumatisk hjärnskada som uppstår till följd av våld mot huvudet. Utav vuxna och barn är det generellt sett barn som klarar sig bättre efter våld mot huvudet men det är ändå till stor del barn som söker akutmottagning p.g.a. skallskada. De flesta av barnen har en så kallad lätt skallskada (ca 90 %)_ medan resten har moderat till svår skallskada. Barnmisshandel_ våld mot huvudet eller skakningar med hjärnskada som följd förekommer oftast bland de yngsta barnen (&lt; 2 år) och dessa klarar sig oftast sämre än övriga barn. För den primära handläggningen utgör de lätta skallskadorna också den största utfordringen; att skilja på dem med större risk att utveckla blödning i hjärnan och de utan risk. Detta bör göras utan att barnen utsätts för alltför många onödiga undersökningar_ röntgenstrålning eller sjukhusinläggningar. I Sverige finns inga nationella riktlinjer för handläggning av lätta skallskador hos barn och handläggningen baseras oftast på lokala riktlinjer_ vuxnas handläggningsriktlinjer och erfarenhet. De vuxna riktlinjerna baseras på den primära medvetandegrad patienten uppvisar vid ankomst till akutmottagningen_ förekomst av kortvarig medvetslöshet eller minnesförlust (amnesi). Dessa symptom är speciellt svåra att värdera på yngre barn som ännu inte utvecklat sina språkfärdigheter. Datortomografi (DT) är liberalt rekommenderat på de med lätta skallskador men inte på de med s.k. minimala skallskador_ d.v.s. de utan symptom. DT är en utmärkt undersökningsmetod för att finna akuta blödningar i hjärnan_ men stråldosen är hög. På senare tid har det diskuterats mycket kring DT:s risker att orsaka cancer. DT anses särskilt riskfyllt bland barn eftersom den effektiva dosen i relation till kroppsmassan är större; barn har även flera delande celler och flera levnadsår än vuxna. En del barn kan även behöva lugnande medicin eller sövning inför en DT undersökning_ vilket bör undvikas såvida inte misstanken om blödning är stor. För att ytterligare förbättra handläggningsrutinerna för de lättare skallskadade patienterna håller man nu på att införa ett blodprov för att mäta förekomst av ett protein kallat S100B. Det är en hjärnskademarkör som ökar i blodet vid hjärnskada. Vid avsaknad av detta protein förekommer ingen hjärnskada och risken att utveckla senare komplikationer eller blödningar är ytterst minimala. Forskningen kring S100B och barn med lätta skallskador har nyligen kommit igång och vissa studier har påvisat positiva resultat om att blodprovet även kan användas för att utesluta traumatisk hjärnskada på barn. Markören är inte det mest optimala proteinet men än så länge det bästa som finns på marknaden. Dock krävs ytterligare studier innan markören kan rekommenderas och introduceras i barnhandläggningen. Denna avhandling försöker uppsummera basfakta_ presentera forskning som är gjord inom skallskadehandläggningen_ diskutera utfordringar inom handläggningen av barnskallskada_ samt introducera andra möjliga metoder att optimera de nuvarande handläggningsrutinerna. Den första studien är en enkätundersökning bland 51 sjukhus och akutmottagningar i Sverige som handlägger barn med skallskada. Studien visar förekomsten av stor variation i handläggning av barn_ särskilt vad gäller DT_ skallröntgen och inläggningskriterier. Barnen handläggs oftast av allmänkirurgerna och till mindre del av barnläkarna. Det är de yngre läkarna (AT-läkare och ST-läkare) som mottar patienterna och barn som är i behov av fortsatt observation läggs oftast in på barnavdelningen eller kirurgiavdelningen_ men även i vissa fall på intensivvårdsavdelningen. De flesta sjukhus saknar ett observationsschema specifikt för dessa barn och både frekvensen och längden på observationerna varierar. Från denna studie konkluderas att svenska sjukhus är i behov av handläggningsrutiner för lätta skallskador på barn. Den andra studien är en journalstudie som undersöker symptom och kliniska faktorer på de barn som överflyttats till en neurointensivvårdsavdelning (NIVA) efter skallskada under åren 2002-2007. Varken kortvarig medvetslöshet eller minnesförlust förekom hos 23 % av de barn som blev inlagda på NIVA_ och 6 barn som senare fick påvisat en hjärnblödning hade man enligt de vuxna riktlinjerna kunnat värdera som minimal skallskada vid första undersökningen; 4 av dessa 6 barn opererades för sin blödning i hjärnan. Därmed konkluderas att handläggningsriktlinjer som baseras enbart på vuxenriktlinjer inte är pålitliga att användas i bedömningen av barn med skallskada. Den tredje studien förflyttar fokus till hjärnskademarkören S100B för att från ett mera laboratoriemässigt perspektiv utreda om protein S100B kan mätas i kapillärt och arteriellt blod_ samt jämföra dessa med ett samtidigt taget venöst prov. Kapillärt prov har den fördelen att vara något smidigare att ta_ det är mindre smärtsamt för barnet jämfört med ett venöst prov och är att föredra speciellt på yngre barn. Blodprov erhölls från vuxna med svår hjärnskada för att säkerställa förhöjda värden. Den kapillära S100B koncentrationen var i medel 0_08 µg/L högre än det venösa_ medan den arteriella var närmast likställt med det venösa. Skattningsfelet vid försök att förutsäga och beräkna venöst S100B från kapillära prover var 0_06 µg/L vilket är rätt högt. Därmed konkluderas att kapillärt S100B prov inte kan likställas med venöst S100B och att det kräver bl.a. separata referensvärden. Den sista och fjärde studien i avhandlingen ger referensvärden på både kapillärt och venöst S100B på barn utan hjärnskada. Referensvärdena är indelade i åldrarna 1_ 2 och 3 år och äldre_ eftersom nivåerna är något högre bland de allra yngsta barnen. Referensvärdena för 3-16 åringarna är 0_14 µg/L (venöst) och 0_40 µg/L (kapillärt). Avhandlingen har visat på problemställningar inom handläggningen av barn med skallskador och har introducerat och försökt optimera användbarheten av hjärnmarkören S100B på barn. Kommande studier bör utvärdera den kliniska rollen och säkerheten av både venöst och kapillärt S100B inom barnskallskadehandläggningen i Skandinavien.","Clinical Aspects of Pediatric Head Injury"

A new casting or moulding method we have developed makes use of a modified composite_ termed SM2C_ or soft magnetic mouldable composite. Use of it makes it possible to design very complex shapes of magnetic flux conductors and also to achieve a better thermal coupling between electromagnetic components_ primarily coils and flux conductors. The latter also creates a new type of problem_ concerning the electrical isolation between the coil and the flux conductor. Use of SM2C_ increases the demands on the isolation layer_ since the molding compound penetrates every single pinhole_ potentially creating leak currents or short circuiting. A comprehensive study of suitable coating materials and processes were carried out_ an evaluation of the electrical strength of different configurations being made. A model of the wetting of rough surfaces is introduced here and is applied in the test analysis. This model makes it possible to explain why a certain isolation layer can be insufficient_ even if the nominal requirements are fulfilled. Multi layer coatings and certain application adjustments are shown to be necessary_ in order for the technical demands placed on isolation to be met.","Electrical isolation of coils in Soft Magnetic Composite applications"

Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based predictors of clinical outcome_ however_ have mostly been studied during sinus rhythm_ whereas noninvasive risk stratification of patients with AF remains largely unexplored. Advances in ECG signal processing have led to the development of noninvasive methods of atrial fibrillatory rate (AFR) assessment using spatiotemporal QRST cancellation and time frequency analysis that demonstrated its predictive value for the outcome of pharmacologic and catheter-based interventions for AF. Recently_ the prognostic value of AFR was evaluated in patients with congestive heart failure and indicated that reduced AFR may be an independent predictor of total and congestive heart failure-related mortality. A high degree of irregularity of the RR intervals during AF and its dependence on the modulation of the atrioventricular conduction rather than sinus node automaticity hampers the use of conventional heart rate variability approach in patients with AF. However_ RR irregularity measures that can be applied to short-time ECG recordings appear to be promising predictors of clinical outcome. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_232410_7","The Multi-plume Aerosol dynamics and Transport (MAT) model has been developed to study the dynamics of the particle size distribution in urban environments. The MAT model uses a novel multi-plume scheme for vertical dispersion and routines of the aerodynamics models AERO3. It treats the processes: emission from a near ground source_ dilution with background air_ deposition_ coagulation and condensation. The employed plume approach is computationally efficient compared to grid models and is therefore suitable for calculating longer time series. The treatment of the different processes in the model was validated against analytical solutions and literature data and later the full model was applied to a field data set from the Copenhagen area. The range of changes in particle concentration including all processes compared to an inert treatment of particles lies between 13% and 23% of loss in total number concentration and 2% loss and 8% gain for the total volume concentration. This agrees well with measurements in Copenhagen that indicated total number concentration (ToN) losses in the range of 15-30% between kerbside and urban rooftop level. The model also reproduces the shift of the maximum in the size distribution to slightly larger diameters between street and urban rooftop level. Because of the uncertainties in the parameters describing the different processes and their similar influence on the particle size distribution_ it is possible to obtain similar results with different parameter combinations. More research and model validation is needed to narrow the range of possible input parameters and model assumptions for this type of modelling.","Multi-plume aerosol dynamics and transport model for urban scale particle pollution"

The use of cell cultures and integrated electrodes is seen as a promising alternative that could potentially solve this problem. In this work_ we present a L-glutamate sensor based on a bienzyme redox hydrogel_ capable of detecting the release of this excitatory neurotransmitter from adherently growing cells upon stimulation. The low working potential required for the operation of the sensor decreases the possibility of interference by easily oxidizable compounds always present in complex biological samples. A low detection limit of 0.5 mu M L-glutamate_ a response time of about 35 s_ and a linear range of up to 60 mu M are the main characteristics of the sensor. The system has been successfully employed to monitor the release of L-glutamate from HN10 and C6 cells upon stimulation with K+-ions. The developed integrated electrochemical platform will be used in future for drug screening and potentially for replacing animal models in neurological experiments.","Glutamate detection from nerve cells using a planar electrodes array integrated in a microtiter plate"

In the present study_ we demonstrate that platelets contribute to the acute response to bacterial infection in a mouse model of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Thrombocytopenia occurred rapidly in infected animals and this was associated with platelet activation_ formation of platelet-neutrophil complexes and neutrophil activation. In order to assess the role of platelets during infection_ platelets were depleted prior to infection. Platelet-depleted animals had significantly decreased platelet-neutrophil complex formation and neutrophil activation in response to infection. Importantly_ significantly fewer bacteria disseminated to the blood_ lungs_ and spleen of platelet-depleted animals. Platelet-depleted animals did not decrease as significantly in weight as the infected control animals. The results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for platelets during the pathophysiological response to infection_ whereby S. pyogenes bacteria bind to platelets and platelets facilitate bacterial dissemination.","Platelets promote bacterial dissemination in a mouse model of streptococcal sepsis."
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_39227_7","Several experiments and theoretical models of intermediate energy heavy ion collision physics are presented in this thesis. Statistical and dynamical aspects of nuclear collisions are widely discussed these days_ particularly in connection with the multifragmentation phenomenon and the possible link to a liquid-gas phase transition in the spinodal region of nuclear matter phase diagram. Experimental techniques which allow us to measure various parameters of hot and dense (equilibrated) regions (emission sources) formed in a heavy ion collision are well established nowadays. In recent CHIC (Celsius Heavy Ion Collaboration) experiments the properties of such sources were measured using slowly ramping mode of the CELSIUS storage ring. In this thesis the entropy and chaos production in nuclear collisions is discussed in connection with the t/d/p ratios. Subthreshold pion production explores collective effects in heavy ion collisions and brings additional information about the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. Continuous pion production excitation functions were measured in the beam energy region from far below the nucleon-nucleon threshold up to the delta dominant region. Mass and angular dependencies of pion production are discussed. A version of the molecular dynamics (MD) model which includes pion production in direct nucleon-nucleon collisions was developed and experimental data were analysed in the scope of this model. Properties of the emission sources formed in heavy ion collisions at energies below 50A MeV were studied in the experiments of fragmentation type performed by CHIC. Temperatures of these sources were extracted from fragment energy spectra and from &quot;isotopic effect&quot;. A version of the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model_ where the Pauli potential is introduced into the Hamiltonian_ was combined with the statistical multifragmentation model (SMM) and used to explore dynamical and statistical properties of the reaction development. The artificial neural networks were utilized for the analysis of data from the CHICSi detector which is described in details in this thesis.","On Experimental and Theoretical Studies of Dynamics and Particle Production in p+Nucleus and Heavy Ion Reactions"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_465288_7","Spectroscopic analysis of scattering media is difficult because the effective path length of the light is non-trivial to predict when photons are scattered many times. The main area of research for such conditions is biological tissues_ which scatter light because of variations of the refractive index on the cellular level. In order to analyze tissues to diagnose diseases_ or predict doses during_ for example_ laser treatment_ it is necessary to be able to model light propagation in the tissue_ as well as quantify the scattering and absorption properties. Problems of this type occur in many other areas as well_ for example in material science_ and atmospheric and ocean-water optics. This thesis deals with light propagation models in scattering media_ primarily based on radiative transport theory. Special attention has been directed to the Monte Carlo model to solve the Boltzmann radiative transport equation_ and to develop faster and more efficient computer methods. A Monte Carlo model was applied to solve a spectroscopic problem in monitoring the emission of gases in smoke plumes. An important theme in the thesis deals with measurement of the optical properties_ with emphasis on biomedical applications. Several different measurement techniques based on a wide range of instruments have been developed or improved upon_ and the strengths and weaknesses of these methods have been evaluated. The measurement techniques have been applied to analyze the scattering and absorption properties of some biological tissues. Much devotion has been directed to optical characterization of blood_ which is an important tissue from a health-care perspective. At present_ the complex scattering properties of blood prevents detailed optical analysis of whole blood. The work presented here is also aimed at acquiring a better understanding of the fundamental scattering processes at a cellular level.","Biomedical and atmospheric applications of optical spectroscopy in scattering media"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_465288_7","Den här doktorsavhandlingen handlar om vad som händer när ljus lyser genom spridande material. Det viktigaste användningsområdet är inom medicin_ men även tillämpningar inom atmosfärsmätningar berörs. Metoderna som är beskrivs är dessutom så generella att de kan användas för alla typer av spridande material_ till exempel olika livsmedel_ papper_ plast_ färg och rök. I ett spridande material finns mikroskopiska variationer i brytningsindex som leder till att en ljusstråle studsar_ eller sprids_ i andra riktningar är den ursprungliga. Ett vardagligt exempel är mjölk_ som består av vatten med små fettdroppar i. Eftersom fettdropparna har ett annat brytningsindex än vattnet sprider de ljuset. Det spridda ljuset är skälet till att mjölken ser vit ut och inte genomskinlig. I själva verket är ljusspridning anledningen till färgen hos alla föremål som upplevs som vita_ till exempel papper_ väggfärg_ vissa plastsorter_ eller moln. Förutom spridning kan det finnas absorption i ett material. Absorption innebär att ljus tas upp och omvandlas till annan energi i materialet_ oftast värme. Ett exempel på ett material som absorberar ljus_ men inte sprider det_ är rött vin. I vinet finns färgämnen som aborberar det blå och det gröna ljuset_ men låter det röda passera. I vävnader_ som till exempel hud_ fett_ muskler_ hjärna_ eller ben_ förekommer både spridning och absorption. Som en jämförelse kan man tänka sig att man blandar mjölk och rödvin. Inom vävnadsoptiken är det viktigt att dels bestämma hur mycket en viss vävnadstyp sprider och absorberar ljuset_ och dels att kunna förutsäga hur ljuset kommer att utbreda sig i en viss vävnadstyp. Synligt ljus är en del av det elektromagnetiska spektret med våglängder mellan ungefär 400 nm (blåviolett ljus) och 700 nm (rött ljus). I den här avhandlingen har vi använt ljus både från traditionella ljuskällor_ som glödtrådslampor_ xenonlampor och solljus_ och från lasrar. För resultaten som presenteras spelar det ingen roll från vilken typ av ljuskälla som har använts. De unika egenskaperna hos laserljuset har inte någon betydelse för dessa mätningar. Anledningen till att laserljus ändå har använts i vissa fall är för att lasrar har vissa praktiska fördelar. De viktigaste är att laserljuset kan vara mycket intensivt_ att det bara har en våglängd_ samt att det går att få ljuspulser som är mycket korta med en laser. I vävnader bestäms absorptionen huvudsakligen av blodets röda färgämne_ hemoglobinet. Absorptionen hos hemoglobin minskar kraftigt för rött och infrarött ljus_ i våglängdsområdet ca 600 - 1000 nm. Spridningen i vävnader är också mindre i detta område än för blått och grönt ljus. Därför talar man om ett optiskt fönster i detta våglängdsområde_ där ljus relativt lätt kan tränga genom vävnaden. En av de viktigaste anledningarna till forskning inom vävnadsoptik är att diagnosticera sjukdomstillstånd med hjälp av ljus_ som cancertumörer. En cancertumör skiljer sig optiskt från normal vävnad både genom att dess absorption och dess spridning är annorlunda. Dessutom beror skillnaderna på vilka våglängder man undersöker. Att mäta så att ljuset delas upp i sina olika våglängder kallas spektroskopi_ och är en mycket viktig analysmetod inom många olika vetenskapliga områden. Olika ämnen har olika absorptionsspektra_ vilket kan användas som fingeravtryck för att identifiera ämnet. Genom att studera absorptionsspektra och spridningsspektra hos vävnader kan man undersöka eventuella skillnader. Förutom att mäta absorptions- och spridningsspektra i de olika vävnaderna vill man även skapa bilder av hur vävnaden ser ut inuti olika kroppsdelar. Detta skulle kunna användas som ett alternativ till röntgenbilder. Problemet med att skapa sådana bilder är spridningen. Röntgenstrålar sprids endast marginellt av vävnad_ och det är därför lätt att ta röntgenbilder. För synligt och infrarött ljus innebär spridningen att bilderna blir så suddiga att de är oanvändbara om man försöker göra samma sak. Det är som att försöka se genom ett glas mjölk. För att komma runt detta problem krävs avancerad teknik_ som exempelvis lasrar med extremt korta ljuspulser_ och nya matematiska modeller för att räkna fram bilderna. Dessa beräkningar kräver mycket datorkraft och tar lång tid_ i vissa fall flera dagar_ även för snabba datorer. Avhandlingen handlar i huvudsak om teorin för ljusspridning i material som vävnad_ med inriktning mot praktiska användningar. Den mest använda teorin kallas transportteori_ och har sitt ursprung i 1800-talets fysik. I transportteorin betraktas ljuset som ett energiflöde som styrs i huvudsak av två faktorer i materialet: spridnings- och absorptionskoefficienten. I teorin finns en grundläggande ekvation_ transportekvationen (se ekvation 3.7)_ som dock är mycket komplicerad att lösa direkt. En stor del av avhandlingen handlar om en särskild teknik för att lösa transportekvationen med hjälp av datorer_ den så kallade Monte Carlo-metoden. Metoden bygger på att man låter datorn simulera &quot;transporten&quot; av ljuset i materialet i form av ljuspartiklar_ så kallade fotonpaket. Monte Carlo-metoden kan användas för i princip alla tänkbara situationer_ men ofta tar beräkningen för lång tid för att vara praktiskt genomförbar. Då kan man i stället använda olika approximativa metoder_ som visserligen inte alltid ger exakt rätt resultat_ men som i gengäld går mycket snabbare att beräkna. Förutom beräkningsmetoderna handlar en väsentlig del i avhandlingen om hur man mäter spridnings- och absorptionskoefficienten. Sådana mätningar är omöjliga att utföra direkt. I stället måste man belysa provet_ t ex vävnaden_ och mäta det ljus som reflekteras tillbaka. Med hjälp av exempelvis Monte Carlo-metoden kan man sedan baklänges räkna ut vilka koefficienterna i provet är. Några tillämpningar av dessa beräknings- och mätmetoder finns också med i avhandlingen. I Paper IV mättes spridnings- och absorptionskoefficienterna i hjärtmuskel före och efter så kallad ablationsterapi_ som innebär att felaktiga nervbanor i hjärtat bränns bort. Kunskapen kan leda till bättre möjligheter för hjärtkirurgen att kontrollera behandlingen. I Paper III gjordes mätningar på bröstvävnad för att ge bakgrundskunskaper för utveckling av en ny_ laserbaserad_ metod att upptäcka bröstcancer. I Paper V och VI undersöktes de optiska egenskaperna hos blod_ vilket kan leda till nya möjligheter att analysera blod direkt utan att behöva ta blodprover. I Paper VII tillämpades Monte Carlo-metoden på mätningar av svaveldioxidutsläpp i rökplymen från vulkanen Etna på Sicilien. Detta ledde till att man nu kan förklara de systematiska fel i uppskattningen av utsläppen som tidigare observerats.","Biomedical and atmospheric applications of optical spectroscopy in scattering media"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_4053431_7","Assessment of costs accompanying activation of immune system and related neuroendocrine pathways is essential for understanding the selective forces operating on these systems. Here we attempted to detect such costs in terms of disruption to redox balance and interference between different immune system components in captive wild-caught greenfinches (Carduelis chloris). Study birds were subjected to an endotoxin-induced inflammatory challenge and temporary exposure to a psychological stressor (an image of a predator) in a 2*2 factorial experiment. Injection of bacterial endotoxin resulted in up-regulation of two markers of antioxidant protection - erythrocyte glutathione_ and plasma oxygen radical absorbance (OXY). These findings suggest that inflammatory responses alter redox homeostasis. However_ no effect on markers of oxidative damage to proteins or DNA in erythrocytes could be detected. We found no evidence that the endotoxin injection interfered with antibody production against Brucella abortus antigen or the intensity of chronic coccidiosis. The hypothesis of within-immune system trade-offs as a cost of immunity was thus not supported in our model system. We showed for the first time that administration of endotoxin can reduce the level of corticosterone deposited into feathers. This finding suggests a down-regulation of the corticosterone secretion cascade due to an endotoxin-induced immune response_ a phenomenon that has not been reported previously. Exposure to the predator image did not affect any of the measured physiological parameters.","Effects of Endotoxin and Psychological Stress on Redox Physiology_ Immunity and Feather Corticosterone in Greenfinches"

Furthermore_ the perceived impact of MS on health_ which takes into account predictors of an increased impact_ is not fully investigated. The variation in perceived needs of health-related services and satisfaction with care over time in people with MS has not been explored. Aims: The overall aims of this thesis were to explore functioning and disability_ perceived impact of MS on health_ perceived needs and satisfaction with care_ including variations over two years_ in people with MS at an outpatient MS specialist clinic. Methods: The 219 people with MS included were followed up every six months over a two-year period by means of tests and questionnaires regarding cognition_ fine hand use_ walking_ energy_ mood_ activities of daily living and social activities. Furthermore_ evaluation of perceived impact of MS on health was performed_ as well as assessment of disease-related variables and contextual factors including sense of coherence_ perceived needs and satisfaction with care. Results: Among the people with MS_ 49% had cognitive impairment; 76%_ limitation in fine hand use; 43%_ walking limitation; 67%_ fatigue; 29%_ depressive symptoms; 44%_ limitations in activities of daily living and_ in 47%_ participation in social activities was restricted. Two or more disabilities were found in 81% and 24% had six or seven disabilities. During the study period_ variations were found in the presence of disability and in nearly all functioning. The variations included improvements and declines but no general deterioration was found except for people with a primary progressive disease course. The perceived physical and psychological impact of MS on health also varied during the study period. A period of more than 10 years since diagnosis_ cognitive impairment_ fatigue and depressive symptoms were independent predictors of increase in perceived physical impact of MS. Weak or moderate sense of coherence_ absence of immunomodulatory treatment_ fatigue and depressive symptoms were independent predictors of increase in perceived psychological impact of MS. Individual variations were found in both perceived needs and satisfaction with care. People with severe MS had a greater perceived need for almost all healthrelated services and women experienced a need for psychosocial support and counselling to a greater extent than men. Among the different categories of health care staff_ people with MS were most satisfied with nurses regarding all dimensions of care. They were least satisfied with the availability of psychosocial support and counselling; as well as of information on social insurance and vocational rehabilitation. Conclusions: A high concurrent presence of disability was found_ regardless of disease severity_ which highlights the importance of making systematic assessments of the level of functioning_ also in individuals with mild MS_ in order to identify disabilities. Knowledge of what are the predictors of increase in perceived physical and psychological impact may be used to identify the people with MS who are in need of special attention. Considering the variation in functioning over time_ a regular and comprehensive assessment of functioning and disability is desirable_ as well as flexibility in the supply of health-related services_ and individualised interventions. Improved availability of rehabilitation services including an increase in the supply of psychosocial support and counselling_ could probably improve satisfaction with care in people with MS.","A two-year study of people with multiple sclerosis : Aspects of disability_ perceived impact_ needs and satisfaction with care"

However_ the major obstacle to its use has been the difficulty in delivering these large anionic molecules in vivo. In this study_ we have investigated whether siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA in mouse lung is influenced by conjugation to the nonviral delivery vector cholesterol and the cell penetrating peptides (CPP) TAT(48-60) and penetratin. Initial studies in the mouse fibroblast L929 cell line showed that siRNA conjugated to cholesterol_ TAT(48-60)_ and penetratin_ but not siRNA alone_ achieved a limited reduction of p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression. Intratracheal administration of siRNA resulted in localization within macrophages and scattered epithelial cells and produced a 30-45% knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA at 6 h. As with increasing doses of siRNA_ conjugation to cholesterol improved upon the duration but not the magnitude of mRNA knockdown_ while penetratin and TAT(48-60) had no effect. Importantly_ administration of the penetratin or TAT(48-60) peptides alone caused significant reduction in p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression_ while the penetratin-siRNA conjugate activated the innate immune response. Overall_ these studies suggest that conjugation to cholesterol may extend but not increase siRNA-mediated p38 MAP kinase mRNA knockdown in the lung. Furthermore_ the use of CPP may be limited due to as yet uncharacterized effects upon gene expression and a potential for immune activation.","Lung delivery studies using siRNA conjugated to TAT(48-60) and penetratin reveal peptide induced reduction in gene expression and induction of innate immunity"

Rethinking of approaches to cardiac rehabilitation is needed. Important is to pay regard to patients risk factor modification_ improvement in their capacity to perform physical work put i relation to the physical demands of various activities and/or jobs in their workplace. It is also known that patients' perceptions of their self-efficacy often exert greater influence over their return to normal activities than does their medical status. Aims: This study examined individual features_ actual and perceived loss of physical capacities in patients with CHD_ in order to develop a new model for cardiac rehabilitation and find relevant assessment instruments. Materialandmethods: 31male and female patients (ages 45-79 yrs) with CHD were assessed prior to and after undergoing a traditional cardiac rehabilitation program. The variables studied included individual goals_ self-efficacy and physical capacities. Results: The results demonstrate great differences in all studied variables. Patients differ in gender_ age_ prior experience_ medical status and individual goals (level of activities/work and or secondary prevention). The physical capacity improves bit may still imply limitations and patients may still lack confidence in their ability to perform physical activities. The vide range of individual features indicates the necessity to individualize the rehabilitation process to meet patient needs. Conclusion: The rehabilitation actors has to take up a more guiding and instructive role regarding elements relevant for the invdividual_ with patients own experience and capacities as the starting point. This include taking measures (separate or extensive) individual or in group.

Därför var utgångspunkten i detta projekt att särskilt undersöka och lyfta fram även ungdomars och kvinnors idéer om framtida arbeten och arbetsplatser i en industriell kontext. Forskningen bestod av att undersöka nya alternativa lösningar för en framtida fabrik genom en serie av förändringsinterventioner med en rad olika aktörer_ genom ett tillvägagångssätt kallat "design labs". Den första fasen bestod av kartläggning av industriella kontexter_ genom undersökningar av olika aktörers erfarenheter i intervjuer och observationer. Detta material användes sedan för utveckling av Personas. I detta projekt användes dessa fiktiva karaktärer både för att kommunicera och utforska olika aktörers erfarenheter i olika aktiviteter. Dessutom bidrog en grupp ungdomar med att utveckla Framtidsscenarier. Scenarierna karaktäriserades som en idealiserad positiv "utopi" och en idealiserad negativ "dystopi"_ som användes för att diskutera konsekvenser och alternativa lösningar. Både Personas och Scenarier användes sedan i en serie Framtidsverkstäder med olika intressegrupper_ t.ex. industriell chefer och arbetstagare och fackliga företrädare. I detta projekt var även en grupp kvinnor och en grupp ungdomar särskilt inbjudna att undersöka visioner om en framtida fabrik. Forskningen som presenteras i denna avhandling bidrar praktiskt med metoder_ verktyg och riktlinjer för reflekterande och innovativ arbete och arbetsplatsdesign. Det teoretiska forskningsbidraget är sambandet mellan teorier och begrepp som förändring_ lärande_ genus och reflekterande design.","Rethinking designing"

The aim was to develop pragmatic tools and guidelines for work and workplace design based on a reflective design tradition. The study was undertaken between 2008-2010 in a research project called the ‘Future Factory’_ which can be characterized as an experiment in change-by-design. The project background was a number of reports on young people opting out of industrial work and women being in the minority within the Swedish industry sector. Therefore_ in this project the ambition was to particularly explore and emphasise young people’s and women’s ideas about future work and workplaces. The research involved exploring alternative solutions for a future factory through a series of change interventions with a variety of actors_ through a so-called ‘design lab’ approach. The initial phase of this approach consisted of context mapping_ as explorations of different actors’ experiences through interviews and observations. The resulting material was portrayed in the form of ‘Personas’. In this project_ these fictional characters were used both to communicate and explore various actors’ perspectives in subsequent collaborative activities. Also_ a group of young people contributed with Future scenarios. The scenarios were characterized as an idealized positive ‘Utopia’ and an idealized negative ‘Dystopia’_ used as tools to discuss implications and alternative solutions. Both Personas and Scenarios were subsequently used in a series of Future Workshops with various project-related interest groups_ such as industrial managers and employees and trade union representatives. In this project_ a group of women and one of young people were also especially invited to explore visions of a future factory. The research presented in this thesis contributes to practice with methods_ tools and guidelines for a reflective and innovative work and workplace design. The theoretical research contribution is the correlation between theories and concepts of change_ learning by doing_ doing gender_ and a reflective design practice.","Rethinking designing"

We show that the improperness of baseband noise relates to the mirrored frequency components in the positive and negative frequency halves. Spectral leakage in the receiver requires in general widely linear estimation (WLE) techniques of the noise instead of less complex linear estimation (LE) techniques. We describe how to take into account for the improperness in the estimation and how it is possible to neglect it by using smooth receiver windowing. This is demonstrated by using two similar but conceptually different noise estimators_ which are based on deterministic and stochastic noise models_ combined with LE or WLE. We also describe some practical properties of improper noise estimation in multicarrier DSL systems by showing intuition pleasing connections to spectral leakage_ receiver windowing_ dimensionality and model parameters_ residual noise interference_ and complexity.","On the estimation of improper noise in multicarrier DSL systems"

The envelope contribution to the line profiles is separated from contributions by outflows and foreground clouds. The envelope contribution is modeled with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer codes for dust and molecular lines (MC3D and RATRAN)_ and the water abundance and the turbulent velocity width as free parameters. <BR /> Results: While the outflows are mostly seen in emission in high-J lines_ envelopes are seen in absorption in ground-state lines_ which are almost saturated. The derived water abundances range from 5\times10^-10 to 4\times10^-8 in the outer envelopes. We detect cold clouds surrounding the protostar envelope_ thanks to the very high quality of the Herschel/HIFI data and the unique ability of water to probe them. Several foreground clouds are also detected along the line of sight. <BR /> Conclusions: The low H_2O abundances in massive dense cores are in accordance with the expectation that high densities and low temperatures lead to freeze-out of water on dust grains. The spread in abundance values is not clearly linked to physical properties of the sources.","Water abundances in high-mass protostellar envelopes: Herschel observations with HIFI"

"oai_services_scigloo_org_196281_7","Reversible phosphorylation of photosystem II (PSII) proteins is an important regulatory mechanism that can protect plants from changes in ambient light intensity and quality. We hypothesized that there is natural variation in this process in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)_ and that this results from genetic variation in the STN7 and STN8 kinase genes. To test this_ Arabidopsis accessions of diverse geographical origins were exposed to two light regimes_ and the levels of phospho-D1 and phospho-light harvesting complex II (LHCII) proteins were quantified by western blotting with anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. Accessions were classified as having high_ moderate or low phosphorylation relative to Col-0. This variation could not be explained by the abundance of the substrates in thylakoid membranes. In genotypes with atrazine-resistant forms of the D1 protein_ low D1 and LHCII protein phosphorylation was observed_ which may be due to low PSII efficiency_ resulting in reduced activation of the STN kinases. In the remaining genotypes_ phospho-D1 levels correlated with STN8 protein abundance in high-light conditions. In growth light_ D1 and LHCII phosphorylation correlated with longitude and in the case of LHCII phosphorylation also with temperature variability. This suggests a possible role of natural variation in PSII protein phosphorylation in the adaptation of Arabidopsis to diverse environments.","Natural variation in phosphorylation of photosystem II proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana: is it caused by genetic variation in the STN kinases?"

In this paper we show how optical manipulation_ imaging and microfluidics can be combined for investigations of single cells. Microfluidic systems have been fabricated and are used_ in combination with optical tweezers_ to enable environmental changes for single cells. The environment within the microfluidic system has been modelled to ensure control of the process. Three biological model systems have been studied with different combinations of optical manipulation_ imaging techniques and microfluidics. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ environmentally induced size modulations and spatial localization of proteins have been studied to elucidate various signalling pathways. In a similar manner the oxygenation cycle of single red blood cells was triggered and mapped using Raman spectroscopy. In the third experiment the forces between the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts were studied in Pisum sativum and Arabidopsis thaliana. By combining different techniques we make advanced biological research possible_ revealing information on a cellular level that is impossible to obtain with traditional techniques.","Optical manipulation and microfluidics for studies of single cell dynamics"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_35971_7","This thesis is concerned with diasporas as increasingly significant transnational actors in emerging global politics_ representing changes in the nature and form of political organisation beyond nation states. Diasporas have witnessed the increased interest of scholars from several disciplines. Whilst they maintain that the new approach on migrants and refugees provides insights into overlooked aspects_ they point out conceptual and analytical confusion and the need for more studies and increased theorisation. On the one hand_ diasporas are increasingly regarded as transnational communities with propensity for multiple identities and a sense of multilocality; they are engaged in various types of activities and interactions across borders_ connecting them to two or more societies simultaneously. On the other hand_ specifically when political ideas and activities are concerned_ diasporas are often still characterised as nationalist actors using cross-border means to strengthen the nation state system; sometimes they are even described in sharp contrast to transnational cosmopolitan social movements. This thesis takes the form of a case-study in order to provide insights into diversity and specific contextual matters but also identify possibilities for further theorisation by providing a good example. The case of the Kurds appeared to encompass many issues of interest contributing to broadening the understanding of diasporas/transnational communities within the complexity of transformations between as well as within nation states. Over the last decade_ certain changes occurred in their region of origin; the Kurdish issue were internationalised_ the Kurds were increasingly recognised as Kurds and the major Kurdish movements declared non-secessionist ambitions. Whilst some attention was paid to Kurdish refugees and the Kurdish diaspora in this context_ to some degree the findings by researchers presented varied and divergent conclusions. On the whole_ the complexity of the case comprised of many issues which would benefit from further elaboration. Methodologically_ the thesis is based on data from texts/documents and loosely structures interviews. It studies two organisations in Germany_ one in France_ one in Belgium_ two in Britain_ two in Sweden and one in the United States_ countries hosting major Kurdish communities from Turkey_ Iran and Iraq. Five of the organisations were established between 1978 and 1985_ whereas four were established in the 1990s making it possible to analyse the important changes and practices between 1978 and 2002. The result shows that in the 1990s_ the Kurdish diaspora organisations not only increased their transnational networks_ but also entered a process going from exile politics and the goal of outright Kurdish independence to successively accommodating ideas concerned with universal human rights_ cultural and political pluralism and post-sovereignty whether they focused on the region of origin or settlement/asylum. The thesis challenges perspectives confined to portray diasporas as exclusive nationalists concerned with exile politics. It supports propositions suggesting that migrants and refugees should increasingly be regarded as diasporas or transnational communities with propensities to absorb global/transnational ideas and processes.","Diaspora global politics : Kurdish transnational networks and accommodation of nationalism"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_36753_7","The need for statistical surveillance has been noted in many different areas_ and examples of applications include the detection of an increased incidence of a disease_ the detection of an increased radiation level and the detection of a turning point in a leading index for a business cycle. In all cases_ preventive actions are possible if the alarm is made early. Several versions of the EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) method for monitoring a process with the aim of detecting a shift in the mean are studied both for the one-sided and the two-sided case. The effects of using barriers for the one-sided alarm statistic are also studied. One important issue is the effect of different types of alarm limits. Different measures of evaluation_ suitable in different types of applications_ are considered such as the expected delay_ the ARL¹_ the probability of successful detection and the predictive value of an alarm_ to give a broad picture of the features of the methods. Results from a large-scale simulation study are presented both for a fixed ARL0 and a fixed probability of a false alarm. It appears that important differences from an inferential point of view exist between the one- and two-sided versions of the methods. It is demonstrated that the method_ usually considered as a convenient approximation_ is to be preferred over the exact version in the overwhelming majority of applications.","Evaluations of some Exponentially Weighted Moving Average methods"
"oai_services_scigloo_org_66393_7","We evaluated whether the association between low education and greater risk of dementia is explained by genetic influences_ using three different types of analyses. The HARMONY study (Swedish for "health" (Hälsa)_ "genes" (ARv)_ "environment" (Miljö)_ "and" (Och)_ and "new" (NY)) includes members of the Swedish Twin Registry who were aged 65 and older and alive in 1998_ and who were screened and clinically assessed for dementia. There were 394 cases with dementia and 7786 unrelated controls. Analyses included co-twin control_ tests for association between education and a measured genotype_ and bivariate twin modeling. Low education was a significant risk factor for dementia both in case-control analyses (odds ratio=1.77_ 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 2.28) and co-twin control analyses with monozygotic twin pairs (odds ratio=3.17_ 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 7.93). Apolipoprotein E genotype was not associated with education and did not account for the relationship between education and dementia. Bivariate twin modeling showed that the association between education and dementia was not mediated by genetic influences in common between education and dementia. The association was mediated by shared environmental influences that were related to both dementia and to education. Low education is confirmed as a risk factor for dementia. Findings from three different analytic approaches showed that genetic influences did not explain this association.","Accounting for the relationship between low education and dementia: a twin study."

We report on an experiment in which subjects participate in a color-naming task in a Wizard-of-Oz controlled human-computer dialog in Swedish. The results show that two annotators were able to categorize the subjects' responses based on pragmatic meaning.

They can play important roles for the promotion of industrial ecology systems oriented management of resources and pollutants on the local and regional level. In this context_ the method of substance flow analysis (SFA) has been argued to be supportive to municipal environmental management_ although_ performing an SFA is often time consuming and demands great deal of work. It may be a task hard to fulfil on a regular basis for many local authorities. A crucial issue is_ then_ to what extent it is possible to learn from other SFA studies? Aiming to contribute to this understanding_ this paper analyses comparative results of SFA case studies of the cadmium metabolism in three structurally different municipalities in Sweden. The analyses illustrate that in addition to specific knowledge gained from a single case study_ there is also general knowledge that may constitute important information for environmental decision-making in other local authorities.","What can we learn from local substance flow analyses? - The review of cadmium flows in Swedish municipalities"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth34226_7","Models for transportation network analysis in the literature typically assume that users always choose shortest or least-cost routes to reach their destinations regardless of the saving these routes offer. Under this assumption_ users are perfectly or unboundedly rational and a flow distribution is in equilibrium when users cannot improve their travel time or cost by unilaterally changing routes. However_ users in practice often switch to alternative routes only when they offer significant time or cost saving_ i.e._ users are boundedly rational. This paper addresses the problem of finding an equilibrium flow distribution when users are boundedly rational. Because link-based conditions for boundedly rational user equilibrium only identities a subset of such distributions_ the formulation herein is path-based and contains complementarity constraints_ a class of constraints that violates standard regularity conditions. The proposed algorithm is distinct from other path-generating schemes because it generates paths for two purposes_ one to make the current solution feasible and the other to find an improved solution.","FINDING BOUNDEDLY RATIONAL USER EQUILIBRIUM FLOWS"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth78482_7","Initial-value stability and transport problems formulated in resistive MHD usually require extensive computations using a very large number of time steps. Although spectral methods are used for the spatial domains_ finite steps are traditionally used for the temporal domain with resulting constraints in terms of CFL-like stability conditions for explicit and accuracy-related issues for implicit methods. The Generalized Weighted Residual Method (GWRM) alleviates these problems by representing the time domain in the form of a Chebyshev series. The solution is obtained as an approximate semi-analytical expression through solving a global system of algebraic equations for the expansion coefficients_ valid for all time_ spatial and physical parameter domains. We demonstrate solutions in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the z-pinch_ using the linearized ideal MHD equations. Including resistivity_ results for resistive g-modes of the reversed-field pinch are also presented. ","Application of the Generalized Weighted Residual Method to stability problems within ideal and resistive MHD"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth4728_7","In this thesis_ the application of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to the analysis of intact proteins is demonstrated. In papers I and II_ the use of ESI-MS for the analysis of noncovalent protein-ligand complexes were discussed. In addition_ the interfacing of liquid chromatography (LC) with ESI-MS and the development of an LC-ESI-MS method were demonstrated in paper III for the quality control of recombinant proteins. Furthermore_ this method was applied in paper IV for the analysis of covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediates.The monitoring of noncovalent complexes by ESI-MS is well established. However_ the varying characteristic of ESI-MS data_ especially in the analysis of noncovalent complexes can make the quantification of such complexes troublesome. In paper I_ it was demonstrated how the variation in the position of the ESI-emitter and the initial droplet size of the electrosprayed droplets_ together with different partitioning of a protein and its ligand in these droplets_ can be the cause of such varying characteristics. Furthermore_ it was shown that the partitioning can be of electrostatic and/or hydrophobic/hydrophilic origin. Thus it was demonstrated that if the ligand is more hydrophobic and thereby more surface active relative to the protein_ decreasing the droplet size or increasing the distance between the electrospray emitter and the sampling orifice will lead to more efficient sampling of the droplet bulk where the ligand concentration is low. This results in a favoured sampling of free protein relative to the protein ligand complex. The opposite was shown to occur if the ligand is more hydrophilic than the protein.In paper II_ Ribonuclease A (RNAse) was used as a model for enzymes acting on polymeric substrates with different chain lengths. Nano-ESI-MS was applied to monitor the noncovalent interactions between RNAse and different target ligands. Among the single building blocks of RNA_ including ribose_ the bases adenine_ guanine_ cytosine and uracil_ and phosphate_ only phosphate was observed to interact at multiple RNAse sites at a higher cone voltage. Furthermore_ monobasic singlestranded deoxycytidylic acid oligomers (dCx) of different lengths (X=6_ 9 and 12)_ and RNAse were analysed with nano-ESI-MS. The deoxycytidylic acid with 12 nucleotides was observed with the highest complex to free protein ratio_ hence indicating the strongest interaction. Finally_ collision induced dissociation of the noncovalent RNAseA-dC6 complex resulted in dissociation of covalently bound cytosine from the nucleotide backbone rather than break up of the noncovalent complex_ illustrating the cooperative effect of multiple noncovalent interactions.In paper III an LC-ESI-MS method was presented capable of analysing proteins 10-100 kDa in size_ from salt-containing liquid samples. The proteins included human protein fragments for the largescale production of antibodies and human protein targets for structural determination_ expressed in E. coli. Also_ glycosylated proteins expressed in Pichia pastoris were analysed. The method provides fast chromatography_ is robust and makes use of cheap desalting/trap columns. In addition it was used with optimised reduction and alkylation protocols in order to minimize protein aggregation of denatured and incorrectly folded proteins containing cysteins_ which otherwise form adducts by disulfide bond formation. Furthermore_ the method was used in paper IV for the quantification of covalent proteinligand intermediates formed enzymatically between PttXET16-34_ a xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) from hybrid aspen_ and the synthetic substrates GalGXXXGGG and GalXXXGXXXG designed in order to function as donor substrates only. Thus covalent GalG-enzyme and GalGXXXG-enzyme complexes were detected. Moreover_ establishing of a pseudo equilibrium for the formation of the covalent GalGXXXG-enzyme complex enabled quantification of the saccharide and enzyme constituents of this equilibrium and determination of the free energy of formation (∆G0). The high mass resolution of the TOF-MS allowed unambiguous assessment of the covalent nature of the glycosyl-enzyme complexes. Morover_ the formation of noncovalent complexes between excess substrate and protein_ which can deteriorate MS-signal and increase spectrum complexity_ was efficiently avoided by the chromatographic step_ which separated the saccharide content from the protein content.","Analysis of noncovalent and covalent protein-ligand complexes by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry"

To make the solution robust_ as few assumptions as possible are made. By using relaxation of forces as the basic level of control more complex information can be derived from the resulting motion. In our system_ the radius and centre of rotation of the door are estimated online. This enables the complete system to have a higher degree of autonomy in an unknown environment. In addition_ the redundancy of the robot is exploited in such a way to drive the system towards a desired configuration.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth52339_7","In this paper_ a new approach to enhance power system security has been suggested by optimal placement of UPFC based on sensitivity indices.

In order to validate the accuracy of the proposed method_ an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) formulation has been used to measure the security in terms of minimum PI values_ with placement of UPFC based on the proposed sensitivity factors.

"oai_DiVA_org_liu105850_7","Traditional impact models combine exposure in the form of scenarios and sensitivity in the form of parameters_ providing potential impacts of global change as model outputs. However_ adaptive capacity is rarely addressed in these models. This paper presents the first spatially explicit scenario-driven model of adaptive capacity_ which can be combined with impact models to support quantitative vulnerability assessment. The adaptive capacity model is based on twelve socio-economic indicators_ each of which is projected into the future using four global environmental change scenarios_ and then aggregated into an adaptive capacity index in a stepwise approach using fuzzy set theory. The adaptive capacity model provides insight into broad patterns of adaptive capacity across Europe_ the relative importance of the various determinants of adaptive capacity_ and how adaptive capacity changes over time under different social and economic assumptions. As such it provides a context for the implementation of specific adaptation measures. This could improve integrated assessment models and could be extended to other regions. However_ there is a clear need for a better theoretical understanding of the adaptive capacity concept_ and its relationship to the actual implementation of adaptation measures. This requires more empirical research and coordinated meta-analyses across regions and economic sectors_ and the development of bottom-up modelling techniques that can incorporate human decision making. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","A spatially explicit scenario-driven model of adaptive capacity to global change in Europe"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu10642_7","The main topic of this thesis is integer quadratic programming with applications to problems arising in the areas of automatic control and communication. One of the most widespread modern control methods is Model Predictive Control (MPC). In each sampling time_ MPC requires the solution of a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. To be able to use MPC for large systems_ and at high sampling rates_ optimization routines tailored for MPC are used. In recent years_ the range of application of MPC has been extended to so-called hybrid systems. Hybrid systems are systems where continuous dynamics interact with logic. When this extension is made_ binary variables are introduced in the problem. As a consequence_ the QP problem has to be replaced by a far more challenging Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem_ which is known to have a computational complexity which grows exponentially in the number of binary optimization variables. In modern communication systems_ multiple users share a so-called multi-access channel. To estimate the information originally sent_ a maximum likelihood problem involving binary variables can be solved. The process of simultaneously estimating the information sent by multiple users is called Multiuser Detection (MUD). In this thesis_ the problem to efficiently solve MIQP problems originating from MPC and MUD is addressed. Four different algorithms are presented. First_ a polynomial complexity preprocessing algorithm for binary quadratic programming problems is presented. By using the algorithm_ some_ or all_ binary variables can be computed efficiently already in the preprocessing phase. In numerical experiments_ the algorithm is applied to unconstrained MPC problems with a mixture of real valued and binary valued control signals_ and the result shows that the performance gain can be significant compared to solving the problem using branch and bound. The preprocessing algorithm has also been applied to the MUD problem_ where simulations have shown that the bit error rate can be significantly reduced compared to using common suboptimal algorithms. Second_ an MIQP algorithm tailored for MPC is presented. The algorithm uses a branch and bound method where the relaxed node problems are solved by a dual active set QP algorithm. In this QP algorithm_ the KKT systems are solved using Riccati recursions in order to decrease the computational complexity. Simulation results show that both the proposed QP solver and MIQP solver have lower computational complexity compared to corresponding generic solvers. Third_ the dual active set QP algorithm is enhanced using ideas from gradient projection methods. The performance of this enhanced algorithm is shown to be comparable with the existing commercial state-of-the-art QP solver \cplex for some random linear MPC problems. Fourth_ an algorithm for efficient computation of the search directions in an SDP solver for a proposed alternative SDP relaxation applicable to MPC problems with binary control signals is presented. The SDP relaxation considered has the potential to give a tighter lower bound on the optimal objective function value compared to the QP relaxation that is traditionally used in branch and bound for these problems_ and its computational performance is better than the ordinary SDP relaxation for the problem. Furthermore_ the tightness of the different relaxations is investigated both theoretically and in numerical experiments.","Integer Quadratic Programming for Control and Communication"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu109385_7","This paper presents a new approach to design multiplierless constant rotators. The approach is based on a combined coefficient selection and shift-and-add implementation (CCSSI) for the design of the rotators. First_ complete freedom is given to the selection of the coefficients_ i.e._ no constraints to the coefficients are set in advance and all the alternatives are taken into account. Second_ the shift-and-add implementation uses advanced single constant multiplication (SCM) and multiple constant multiplication (MCM) techniques that lead to low-complexity multiplierless implementations. Third_ the design of the rotators is done by a joint optimization of the coefficient selection and shift-and-add implementation. As a result_ the CCSSI provides an extended design space that offers a larger number of alternatives with respect to previous works. Furthermore_ the design space is explored in a simple and efficient way. The proposed approach has wide applications in numerous hardware scenarios. This includes rotations by single or multiple angles_ rotators in single or multiple branches_ and different scaling of the outputs. Experimental results for various scenarios are provided. In all of them_ the proposed approach achieves significant improvements with respect to state of the art.","Low-Complexity Multiplierless Constant Rotators Based on Combined Coefficient Selection and Shift-and-Add Implementation (CCSSI)"

In the first part of the presentation the environmental potential of LFM on the national scale of Sweden will be quantified in terms of selected impact categories (global warming potential material and energy resource flows etc.). Preliminary results show that this overall potential is huge and could for instance lead to avoided climate gas emissions corresponding to 4–5 times the annual Swedish emissions. Critical factors (efficiency of waste technology transportation distances etc.) determining to what extent such potentials can be realised in practice i.e. in specific LFM–projects will then be discussed. The second and final part of the presentation will solely focus on conditions for realisation. Here we will discuss under what circumstances LFM is profitable and contributes to economic growth. Our ongoing research show that only the raw material value of Swedish waste deposits is beyond 10 billion Euros (€). However no matter how large the economic potential appears on the national scale the realisation of LFM will always be done by actors on the project level. For these individual companies benefits must simply outweigh the costs. There are however many factors that may influence the profitability of specific projects such as revenues for recovered materials efficiency of technology environmental taxes and waste disposal fees labour regulatory compliance expenses and so on. We will categorise such factors into a few critical drivers enablers and barriers for implementation of LFM and discuss them in terms of technology legislation and market interactions."","Environmental and economic conditions for landfill mining"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu45755_7","Purpose – The purpose of the paper is to present and discuss the Kansei engineering (KE) methodology_ and to reflect on the future development of KE. The paper presents a model of the KE methodology and illustrates how this model was applied on a simple example which all may understand – design of a new chocolate bar.Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology is a combination of desk research (literature analysis)_ data collection_ data analysis_ reflections and model building.Findings – The paper suggests a structural model as a possible expanded framework for future Kansei/affective engineering research studies. According to the model profound affection is a result of the following six enabler factors: sensing experience; emotional experiences (Kansei); behavioural experiences/action; social experiences/interactions and relations; spiritual experiences/moral_ ethics; intellectual experiences/cognition.Originality/value – The paper defines “Profound affection” as a very comprehensive state_ which is a result of a combination of sensing_ intellectual/cognitive_ emotional_ social_ behavioural and spiritual experiences. “Profound affection” is not only a result of sensing or emotional experiences.","Kansei/affective engineering design"

Thirty-three percent of patients with NT-pro-BNP more than 1380 ng l(-1)_ and 14.6% of patients below that threshold died within 30 days (log rank P 0.005). NT-pro-BNP correlated moderately with SAPS 3 and with SOFA on admission (Spearmans rho 0.5552 and 0.5129_ respectively). In quartiles of NT-pro-BNP elevation on admission_ severity of illness and mortality increased significantly (30-day mortality 36.1%; OR 3.9; 95% CI_ 2.0 to 7.3 in the quartile with the highest values_ vs. 12.8% in the lowest quartile). less thanbrgreater than less thanbrgreater thanConclusion We conclude that NT-pro-BNP is commonly elevated on admission to intensive care_ that it increases with severity of illness and that it is an independent predictor of mortality.","Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide as a predictor of outcome in patients admitted to intensive care.

"oai_DiVA_org_lnu15720_7","Manufacturing products with greater added value is increasingly viewed as a strategic goal of forest products industries. Added value is defined here as the difference in economic value between the physical inputs and outputs of a production process_ and is generally analysed at the firm or national economy level. In this study we identify and discuss issues involved in quantifying added value at the industrial process level_ and develop a bottom-up method to estimate the value added by forest industry processes. We calculate the value added by 14 traditional and emerging processes within the Swedish forest products industries_ and express the results using various indices. We find that the type of biomass input strongly influences the potential for adding value_ with sawlogs allowing more added value and being less sensitive to input price fluctuations than pulpwood and forest residues. Structural wood products such as lumber and glue-laminated beams are found to give the greatest value added. Co-production of multiple products from a single raw material increases total value added. Integrating the value chain of pulp and paper production significantly increases the value added to pulpwood. Multiple conversion processes exist for using forest residues as fuel_ with a range of potential added value. Consideration of the climate benefits of forest product use_ through the application of a carbon tax_ significantly increases the added value.","Process-based analysis of added value in forest product industries"

Aesthetical reasons and enhancement of life are the main offers. This ongoing ethnographic study focuses on the interaction between adolescents_ parents_ orthodontists and assistants during three activities that precede a possible treatment with fixed appliance; consultation_ examination and information. It aims to understand how aesthetical norms are discussed and negotiated_ how deviation of the bite is evaluated_ and how adolescents_ parents_ orthodontists and material representations interact.A combination of theoretical perspectives from Science and Technology Studies and medical sociology/anthropology are used in order to understand clinical practice as collaboration and interaction between practitioners and patients. Drawing from childhood studies I also explore the young patients as social actors_ that both influence and are influenced by clinical and technical practices_ when bodily deviations are observed and corrected. The initial analyses show that the consultation is a quick evaluation of the deviation. The adolescents negotiate the necessity of the treatment and some ask for a second opinion when denied treatment. Examination_ on the other hand_ does not include negotiations_ but is embedded in many organizational routines. The deviation is visualized in a number of ways which includes procedures that are bodily intrusive and sometimes painful. Finally_ the information is an agreement of the road to a future bite. In front of the computer the patient_ a parent and the orthodontist discuss all visualizations and imagine the future bite.","An improved smile"

Research work within both the deterministic and stochastic environments are summarised. Certain aspects related to model formulation are also discussed. Our aim is to give a generalunderstanding of the capacitated lot-sizing problem rather than a comprehensive literature study. The literature covered is mostly since 1980. A basic aim is also to create a background to generalisations of theoretical developments on material requirements planning applying input-output analysis and Laplace transforms.","Modelling capacity-constrained production-inventory systems"

This multiple-case study presents standardized perimetry results in six teenagers and young adults born prematurely with visual dysfunction due to white matter damage of immaturity of pre- or perinatal origin. METHODS: Six subjects_ aged 13-25 years_ born at a gestational age of 28-34 weeks_ with white matter damage of immaturity documented by MRI_ and optic disc appearances documented by fundus photography_ were examined with manual and computerized quantitative perimetry. RESULTS: All subjects had subnormal visual field (VF) function_ although the depth and extension of the VF defects differed between subjects. The inferior VF function was more deviant than the superior in all cases. The concordance between the VF defects detected with the different techniques was good_ although the static computerized techniques revealed slightly more abnormality. CONCLUSION: White matter damage of immaturity may affect the VF. The lower VF is often more affected than the upper. The abnormalities can be demonstrated by both manual and computerized perimetry.","Visual field defects in prematurely born patients with white matter damage of immaturity"

The developments as well as the needs of the respective disciplines and practices (e.g. anticipatory rule based simulation_ GIS_ regional policy) that could underwrite and/or hinder the development of Anticipatory Rule Based Spatial Simulation Systems (ARBS3) are reviewed. This review_ apart from bringing forth a number of possibilities for advancement_ also identifies some of the gaps that need to be filled. Some specific combinations are also proposed_ along with the criteria that may be used to evaluate them.

"oai_DiVA_org_oru30871_7","Leaching of trace elements (Cd_ Cu_ Pb and Zn) from oxidized waste rock amended with different alkaline by-products was studied during flooding. It has been argued that water covers for oxidized waste would significantly increase leaching through reductive dissolution of the pre-formed hydrous ferric oxides and the associated trace elements. After approximately three weeks pH in the reference had reached 2.5 and 3.3 in the pore and overlying water_ respectively. This can be compared with pH from 6.1 (water works granules) to above 10 (lime kiln dust) in the amended systems. It is clear that the carbonate dominated alkaline by-products have lower pH than the oxide/hydroxide based by-products. However_ the systems amended with carbonate based by-products have significantly higher alkalinity. Cadmium_ Cu_ Pb and Zn concentrations within the waste decreased with at least 99% compared to the reference. In most systems the surface waters can even be used as drinking water. Cadmium_ copper and zinc concentrations are clearly related to pH with decreasing concentrations with increasing pH. Lead concentrations_ on the other hand_ decrease to pH 8_ where the concentrations start to increase slightly again due to the formation of soluble Pb(OH)₃⁻ and Pb(OH)₄²⁻ species. The results indicate that flooding of oxidized waste rock amended with alkaline by-products can be used as a successful remediation technique.","Flooding of oxidized waste rock amended with alkaline by-products"
"oai_DiVA_org_oru3226_7","Although it seems that genetic factors can influence individual susceptibility to noise_ still very little is known about the genes or the mechanisms involved. The connexin 26 (Cx26) (GJB2) gene is of particular interest to study in relation to noise_ since the gene encodes the gap junction protein Cx26. Noise has a metabolic and mechanical effect on the inner ear and may_ therefore_ interfere with gap junction channels. In order to investigate whether abnormally high susceptibility to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in humans is associated with the common 35delG mutation in the Cx26 gene_ 1200 noise‐exposed workers were investigated in Sweden. Using a selection procedure based on audiometric analysis_ noise exposure data and questionnaires_ noise‐exposed workers were divided into two categories: noise susceptible and noise resistant. There was a correspondence in noise susceptibility between this noise‐exposed population and the international reference ISO Standard 1999. Blood samples were drawn from 245 highly selected male subjects (103 noise susceptible_ 112 noise resistant and 30 randomized cases)_ and genomic DNA was analysed with respect to the Cx26 35delG mutation. The incidence of 35delG carriers among this cohort was determined by multiplex_ allele‐specific PCR. Two of the 245 subjects (0.8% ‐ [95% confidence interval 0.1–2.9]) were found to be heterozygous carriers of the 35delG mutation_ while the remaining 243 subjects were all non‐carriers. Both the heterozygous carriers were found in the noise susceptible group. Statistical evaluation of the results demonstrated no significant difference in carrier incidence between the noise susceptible and noise resistant individuals in our Swedish noise‐exposed population. In conclusion_ there was no support for a major role of Cx26 35delG mutation in explaining the variability in noise susceptibility in this Swedish population.","Variabillity in noise susceptibility in a Swedish population"

Sociologists argue that we live in an age when fear and anxiety are increasingly evident in public discourse; this paper explores Swedish conceptions of emergency calls_ in light of this trend. A qualitative study examined eight focus groups_ each containing 36 Swedish citizens aged 16–71 years_ concerning various uses of mobile telephony. The paper concludes that citizen mobile telephony use places great demands on the public safety answering point (PSAP).

"oai_DiVA_org_sh12187_7","Based on strong philosophical traditions_ cognitive science results and recent discourses within the discipline of knowledge organization_ the authors argue for a perspectivist approach to concepts in information systems. In their approach ontology is dissociated from concept_ and instead conceptualization is left up to the epistemic activity of the information system user. A new spatial ontology model is explicated that supports multiple perspective-relative conceptual projections of the same domain. With an example domain and a demo application they provide a preliminary proof of concept of how different perspectives yield alternative classifications_ categorizations and hierarchies_ all the way to a different ways of narrating the domain. The results suggest the potential of multi-perspective knowledge organization systems that not support search and retrieval of information but even the articulation and conceptual disposition of information.","Epistemic pluralism and multi-perspective knowledge organization"

With the case of Karagwe district inTanzania_ the paper suggests that the policy of ‘Swahili only’ in primary school education inTanzaniafavors the small minority of the school children that live in a context where Swahili is used. This appears to lead to inequality in pupils’ chances in education and to a low level of achievement of academic content in schools. This also promotes the development and use of what I call safety strategies among teachers and pupils that hide failure and prevent pupils’ learning.","Language attitudes and schooled education"
"oai_DiVA_org_su106764_7","This article contributes both to the expanding literature on the effect of school choice and to the literature focusing on how to measure and conceptualize neighborhood effects. It uses a novel approach to the measurement of geographical context to analyze neighborhood influences on school choice attitudes among Swedish parents. Data on attitudes come from a survey of 3_749 families with children in upper primary school. Geographical context is measured using multi-scalar contextual factors based on socioeconomic indicators for individually defined_ bespoke neighborhoods that incorporate from 12 to 12_800 people. The results show that parental motives for choosing schools in Sweden are strongly influenced by the social and ethnic composition of their own and their adjacent neighborhoods. Contrary to most other studies_ we find effects of socioeconomic context stronger than the effects of the parents' own social and ethnic background. Thus_ parents living in academic_ high-income areas put little stress on attending an assigned school_ close-to-home schools_ or stating that the municipality has influenced their decision. Furthermore_ these attitudes become even stronger if nearby neighborhoods are dominated by visible minorities and disadvantaged groups. Supported by Sampson's ideas of coordinated perceptions among inhabitants in the same neighborhoods_ we explain these surprisingly strong contextual effects with the idea that school choice motives are especially sensitive to neighbors' ideas and easily influenced as measured preferences in a survey.","Composite Geographical Context and School Choice Attitudes in Sweden"
"oai_DiVA_org_su43080_7","We investigate constraints on dark energy fluctuations using type Ia supernovae. If dark energy is not in the form of a cosmological constant_ that is if the equation of state is not equal to -1_ we expect not only temporal_ but also spatial variations in the energy density. Such fluctuations would cause local variations in the universal expansion rate and directional dependences in the redshift-distance relation. We present a scheme for relating a power spectrum of dark energy fluctuations to an angular covariance function of standard candle magnitude fluctuations. The predictions for a phenomenological model of dark energy fluctuations are compared to observational data in the form of the measured angular covariance of Hubble diagram magnitude residuals for type Ia supernovae in the Union2 compilation. The observational result is consistent with zero dark energy fluctuations. However_ due to the limitations in statistics_ current data still allow for quite general dark energy fluctuations as long as they are in the linear regime.","Constraining dark energy fluctuations with supernova correlations"

However_ so far mostly stable carbon isotope analysis of methyl chloride and methyl bromide has been at­tempted. One obstacle to progress with their other isotope systems has been the challenge to obtain sufficiently large amounts of methyl halides to meet the detection limits of existing isotope analytical methods. A compound-specific technique using gas chromatography multiple-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-MC-ICPMS) has in this work been developed to measure 81Br/79Br isotope ratios in CH3Br. This ICPMS method is three orders of magnitude more sensitive compared to existing gas source mass spectrometry methods (dual inlet and continuous flow) for Br isotope determination and thus opens up possibilities for applications toward ambient atmospheric samples to investigate the sources and sinks of methyl halides.","Compound-specific bromine isotope analysis of methyl bromide using GC-multiple collector mass spectrometry"
"oai_DiVA_org_umu11820_7","The mechanisms governing the body's response to physical exercise have been investigated from various perspectives including metabolism_ nutrition_ age and sex. Increased attention to the immune system during recent decades is reflected by a rapidly growing number of publications in the field. This article highlights the most recent findings and only briefly summarises more basic concepts already reviewed by others. Topics include Th1/Th2 cytokine balance_ inoculation time_ age and immune compensation. Some less investigated areas are discussed including studies in children_ the environment and dendritic cells. Because physical exercise enhances some aspects and suppresses other aspects of immunity_ the biological significance of alterations in the immune system are unknown. So far_ no link between immunological alterations and infection rate has been established and infection after strenuous physical exercise is equally likely to be the result of exercising with an already established rather than a new infection. If there is an increased risk for infections with increased exercise duration and intensity_ why do overtrained athletes not display the greatest risk for upper respiratory tract infections? Increased knowledge on immune system modulations with physical exercise is relevant both from a public health and elite athlete's point of view.","Exercise immunology"

Despite this_ there are few validated challenge recipes available. The present study aimed to validate new recipes for low-dose double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges in school children_ by investigating whether there were any sensory differences between the active materials containing cow's milk_ hen's egg_ soy_ wheat or cod_ and the placebo materials. The challenge materials contained the same hypoallergenic amino acidbased product_ with or without added food allergens. The test panels consisted of 275 school children_ aged 810 and 1415yr_ respectively_ from five Swedish schools. Each participant tested at least one recipe. Standardized blinded triangle tests were performed to investigate whether any sensory differences could be detected between the active and placebo materials. In our final recipes_ no significant differences could be detected between the active and placebo materials for any challenge food (p&gt;0.05). These results remained after stratification for age and gender. The taste of challenge materials was acceptable_ and no unfavourable side effects related to test materials were observed. In summary_ these new validated recipes for low-dose double-blinded food challenges contain common allergenic foods in childhood; cow's milk_ hen's egg_ soy_ wheat and cod.

Our findings are based on 12 in-depth interviews_ 2 focus-group discussions_ 6 key informant interviews with AIDS activists_ and open-ended responses derived from 148 HIV-positive persons in a quantitative survey. The study was conducted in 2008-2009 in Kampala_ Mpigi_ and Soroti districts in Uganda. We found both parents and adult children facing dilemmas in disclosure_ whether it was parents revealing their own HIV status to their children or the status of their perinatally infected children_ or young people infected through sexual intercourse telling their parents. For both groups_ there is fear of blame_ stigma_ discrimination_ and shame and guilt related to unsafe sex_ while young people also fear loss of privileges. On the other hand_ there are practical imperatives for disclosure in terms of gaining access to care_ treatment_ and material resources. Faced with these dilemmas_ HIV-positive people and their families require professional counselling to help them work through the emotional challenges encountered and identify mechanisms of support and coping.","Disclosure of HIV status between parents and children in Uganda in the context of greater access to treatment"

For total taste intensity_ acidity and bitterness_ there was an interaction between growing system and variety. In a controlled experiment_ nutritiously poor growing substrate produced a low yield of sweet_ firm and less juicy tomatoes. Nutritiously rich growing substrate produced a high yield of less sweet_ less firm but juicier tomatoes. Late harvest resulted in an increase of total taste intensity and a decrease of the bitter taste of the tomatoes.Conventionally grown carrots scored high for carrot-taste_ while ecologically grown scored high for bitter taste. In one out of two years conventionally grown carrots were sweeter and crunchier while ecologically grown carrots were harder. Conventionally produced wheat samples had significantly higher protein levels compared with ecologically produced wheat samples. The volume of the wholemeal bread was related to the protein content and there was a close relationship between volume and elasticity of the bread.It was observed that information on labelling as being ecologically grown caused an increase in product rating. For sweet tomatoes with high tomato taste intensity_ the information on them being grown ecologically was less important for consumer preference.

The focus of the paper is on the role that the centrifugal effects on the plasma equilibrium play for the stability of this mode_ and results from one code where centrifugal effects are self-consistently included (CASTOR-FLOW) [E. Strumberger et al_ Nucl. Fusion 45_ 1156 (2005)] are compared with the results from another code where such effects are not taken into account (MISHKA-F) [I. T. Chapman et al._ Phys. Plasmas 13_ 062511 (2006)]. It is found that_ even at rather modest flow speeds_ the centrifugal effects are very important for the stability of the internal kink mode. While the results from the two codes can be quite similar for certain profiles in the plasma_ completely opposite results are obtained for other profiles. A very good agreement between analytical theory and the numerical results are_ both for inconsistent and consistent equilibria_ found for plasmas with large aspect ratio. From the analytical theory_ the distinctly different stability properties of equilibria with and without centrifugal effects included can be traced to the stabilizing effect of the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) induced by the plasma rotation. This GAM exists solely as a consequence of the nonuniform plasma density and pressure created by the centrifugal force on the flux surfaces_ and a stabilizing coupling of the internal kink instability to this mode cannot therefore take place if the centrifugal effects are not included in the equilibrium. In addition to the GAM stabilization. the effects of the radial profiles of the plasma density and rotation velocity are also found to be significant_ and the importance of these effects increases with decreasing aspect ratio.","Importance of centrifugal effects for the internal kink mode stability in toroidally rotating tokamak plasmas"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu139837_7","Executive functions_ including working memory and inhibition_ are of central importance to much of human behavior. Interventions intended to improve executive functions might therefore serve an important purpose. Previous studies show that working memory can be improved by training_ but it is unknown if this also holds for inhibition_ and whether it is possible to train executive functions in preschoolers. In the present study_ preschool children received computerized training of either visuo-spatial working memory or inhibition for 5 weeks. An active control group played commercially available computer games_ and a passive control group took part in only pre- and posttesting. Children trained on working memory improved significantly on trained tasks; they showed training effects on non-trained tests of spatial and verbal working memory_ as well as transfer effects to attention. Children trained on inhibition showed a significant improvement over time on two out of three trained task paradigms_ but no significant improvements relative to the control groups on tasks measuring working memory or attention. In neither of the two interventions were there effects on non-trained inhibitory tasks. The results suggest that working memory training can have significant effects also among preschool children. The finding that inhibition could not be improved by either one of the two training programs might be due to the particular training program used in the present study or possibly indicate that executive functions differ in how easily they can be improved by training_ which in turn might relate to differences in their underlying psychological and neural processes.","Training and transfer effects of executive functions in preschool children"

The objective for the presented study was to show the unique ability of the porous graphitized carbon surface to separate closely structurally related substances. Experimental results_ using Hypercarb and “chromatographic normal phase conditions” (SFC)_ are presented with focus on how to control retention and to improve peak performance. A high concentration of basic aliphatic amine additive was required in order to elute the amine analytes as symmetrical peaks. N_N-Dimethyloctylamine was preferred over triethylamine since the retention was markedly shorter though the selectivity and resolution were virtually the same. The selectivity can be optimized by altering the temperature of the column. A high selectivity was demonstrated between metoprolol and two homologues with one and two extra methylene groups inserted between the secondary nitrogen atom and the carbon atom with a hydroxyl group attached. The mobile phase flow rate effect the column efficiency only to a minor extent as the steepness of the van Deemter curve for metoprolol was virtually flat in the range studied: 0.5–3.0 mL min−1.","Evaluation Conditions for SFC of Metoprolol and Related Amino Alcohols on Hypercarb (Porous Graphitic Carbon) with Respect to Structure–Selectivity Relations"

Yet_ the interfaces determine the properties of nanocomposites and nanolaminates. An example is nanocomposites with extreme hardness &gt;= 70-90 GPa_ which is of the order of_ or higher than_ diamond. The Ti-Si-N system_ in particular_ is attracting attention for the synthesis of such superhard materials. In this case_ the nanocomposite structure consists of TiN nanocrystallites encapsulated in a fully percolated SiNx "tissue phase" (1 to 2 monolayers thick) that is assumed to be amorphous. Here_ we show that the interfacial tissue phase can be crystalline_ and even epitaxial with complex surface reconstructions. Using in situ structural analyses combined with ab initio calculations_ we find that SiNx layers grow epitaxially_ giving rise to strong interfacial bonding_ on both TiN(001) and TiN(111) surfaces. In addition_ TiN overlayers grow epitaxially on SiNx/TiN(001) bilayers in nanolaminate structures. These results provide insight into the development of design rules for new nanostructured materials.","Interface structure in superhard TiN-SiN nanolaminates and nanocomposites"

We compare our results with the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD result and find that saturation effects are large for neutrino energies above 10^6 GeV_ leading to a substantial suppression of the prompt neutrino flux. We comment on the range of prompt neutrino fluxes due to theoretical uncertainties.","Prompt neutrino fluxes from atmospheric charm"

For example_ a variety of compounds have beneficial effects within the central nervous system (CNS)_ but unwanted side effects in the periphery. For such compounds_ traditional oral or intravenous drug delivery fails to provide benefit without cost. However_ intranasal delivery is emerging as a noninvasive option for delivering drugs to the CNS with minimal peripheral exposure. Additionally_ this method facilitates the delivery of large and/or charged therapeutics_ which fail to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus_ for a variety of growth factors_ hormones_ neuropeptides and therapeutics including insulin_ oxytocin_ orexin_ and even stem cells_ intranasal delivery is emerging as an efficient method of administration_ and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diseases with CNS involvement_ such as obesity_ Alzheimer's disease_ Parkinson's disease_ Huntington's disease_ depression_ anxiety_ autism spectrum disorders_ seizures_ drug addiction_ eating disorders_ and stroke.","Intranasal Treatment of Central Nervous System Dysfunction in Humans"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu185414_7","This paper presents arguments for a synthesis of two frameworks proposed for defining cross-linguistic types of clause-linking strategies. One framework was introduced by Johanson in 1993 and developed in later works (e.g. 1996). The other one is a more recent general typological framework put forward by Dixon &amp; Aikhenvald (eds.) 2009. None of these models can be accounted for in any detail in this paper. Just very brief summaries of the main ideas will be given here. The aim is to illustrate that both syntactic and semantic criteria are needed in order to account for the types of clause linking strategies in Turkic. Syntactic properties cannot be derived from semantic features or vice versa. The syntactic distinction between main and non-main clauses is not sufficient in order to describe clause linking strategies. Cross-linguistic typological classifications based on pure semantic criteria are not satisfactory.","Clause linking in spoken Turkish"

Social insurance replacement rates have figured prominently here. Apparently_ there is considerable confusion about the validity of replacement rates and their comparability across different datasets. The purpose of this study is to outline a refined institutional perspective in the comparative analysis of welfare states focusing on the character of social citizenship rights. We show that social insurance replacement rates from different datasets differ in their underlying theoretical framework for policy analysis and therefore capture different aspects of how welfare states secure the livelihood of citizens in periods of work incapacity. Analysing validity solely on the basis of replacement rate point estimates is therefore misleading. We show that the close focus on social citizenship rights and programmatic design in the Social Citizenship Indicator Programme (SCIP) carries great potential for causal welfare state analysis.","Social citizenship rights and social insurance replacement rate validity"

Symptoms and aspects of management were retrieved from surgery and primary care records. Outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression.RESULTS:Among patients reported as emergencies_ 158/263 (60 %) underwent operation within three days (acute)_ and 105 (40 %) after more than 3 days (subacute). In the latter group_ 20/94 (21 %) had reported two symptoms_ and 31/94 (33 %) had reported three or more symptoms associated with colon cancer to primary care during the last 12 months prior to surgery. In total_ 46/105 (44 %) had already had an examination of the large bowel_ and 52/105 (50 %) were stage IV_ as opposed to 36/158 (23 %) in the acute group and 83/577 (15 %) in the elective group (p &lt; 0.001). Mortality at 30 and 90 days was 15.2 and 35.6 % in the subacute group_ 8.2 and 14.9 % in the acute group (p = 0.001)_ and 1.9 and 4.3 % in the elective group (p &lt; 0.001); 5-year survival was 28.3_ 40.1_ and 57.8 %_ respectively_ in the three groups (p &lt; 0.001).

"oai_DiVA_org_uu2696_7","This thesis deals with evolutionary relationships within the asterids_ a group of plants comprising about one-third of all flowering plants.Two new families are recognised: Pennantiaceae and Stemonuraceae. The woody Pennantia from New Zealand and Australia is the sole genus of Pennantiaceae. Stemonuraceae consist of a dozen woody genera with a pantropical distribution and a centre of diversity in South East Asia and the Malesian islands. They are characterised by long hairs on their stamens and/or fleshy appendages on their fruits. Both families were formerly included in Icacinaceae. While Pennantiaceae are unrelated to any of the former Icacinaceae and placed in the order Apiales_ other former Icacinaceae genera are related to Cardiopteris_ a twining herb from South East Asia and Malesia. The monogeneric family Cardiopteridaceae is enlarged as to include also these. Cardiopteridaceae and Stemonuraceae are sister groups and placed in Aquifoliales. The three other families of Aquifoliales are monogeneric and closely related. The Asian Helwingiaceae and the Central/South American Phyllonomaceae are suggested to be merged into Aquifoliaceae (hollies). The genera of Icacinaceae in the traditional sense not placed in any of the above families (all euasterids II) are members of early diverging lineages of the euasterids I and possibly included in the order Garryales.The three woody Australasian families Alseuosmiaceae_ Argophyllaceae_ and Phellinaceae are confirmed as members of Asterales_ despite traditional placements not close to that order. They are_ moreover_ supported as each other’s closest relatives.The results are based mainly on parsimony analysis of DNA sequence data_ but morphological studies have revealed characters in support for the molecularly based conclusions. The gene that has provided most new information is the chloroplast ndhF gene. The results are_ however_ drawn from combined analyses of sequences from one or several additional genes (atpB_ matK_ rbcL_ 18S rDNA). The data have also been explored with Bayesian analysis_ a statistical_ model-based method that most recently has been developed for phylogeny reconstruction.","Evolutionary Studies in Asterids Emphasising Euasterids II"

Several groups have previously studied these losses on particular examples. Now_ the availability of a large (11491 entries) SwedECD database (http://www.bmms.uu.se/CAD/indexECD.html) of high-resolution ECD data sets on doubly charged tryptic peptides has made possible a systematic study involving statistical evaluation of neutral losses from [M + 2H](+center dot) ions. Several new types of losses are discovered_ and 16 specific (&gt;94%) losses are characterized according to their specificity and sensitivity_ as well as occurrence for peptides of different lengths. On average_ there is more than one specific loss per ECD mass spectrum_ and two-thirds of all MS/MS data sets in SwedECD contain at least one specific loss. Therefore_ specific neutral losses are analytically useful for improved database searching and de novo sequencing. In particular_ N and GG isomeric sequences can be distinguished. The pattern of neutral losses was found to be remarkably dissimilar with the losses from radical z(center dot) fragment ions: e.g._ there is no direct formation of w ions from the reduced species. This finding emphasizes the difference in fragmentation behaviors of hydrogen-abundant and hydrogen-deficient species.","Analytical utility of small neutral losses from reduced species in electron capture dissociation studied using SwedECD database"

METHODS: Seventeen unrelated families with RP and an apparent X-linked pattern of disease inheritance were identified from the Swedish RP registry and screened for mutations in the RP2 and RPGR (for the RP3 disease) genes. These families had been previously screened for the RPGR exons 1-19_ and disease-causing mutations were identified in four of them. In the remaining 13 families_ we sequenced the RP2 gene and the newly discovered RPGR-ORF exon. Detailed clinical evaluations were then obtained from individuals in the three families with identified mutations. RESULTS: Mutations in RP2 and RPGR-ORF15 were identified in three of the 13 families. Clinical evaluations of affected males and carrier females demonstrated varying degrees of retinal dysfunction and visual handicap_ with early onset and severe disease in the families with mutations in the ORF15 exon of the RPGR gene. CONCLUSIONS: A total of seven mutations in the RP2 and RPGR genes have been discovered so far in Swedish XLRP families. All affected individuals express a severe form of retinal degeneration with visual handicap early in life_ although the degree of retinal dysfunction varies both in hemizygous male patients and in heterozygous carrier females. Retinal disease phenotypes in patients with mutations in the RPGR-ORF15 were more severe than in patients with mutations in RP2 or other regions of the RPGR.","Clinical studies of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa in three Swedish families with newly identified mutations in the RP2 and RPGR-ORF15 genes"

It has been proposed that cadmium&#39;s toxic effect on bone is exerted via impaired activation of vitamin D_ secondary to the kidney effects. To test this_ we assessed the association of cadmium-induced bone and kidney effects with serum 1_25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1_25(OH)(2)D); measured by enzyme immunoassay. For the assessment_ we selected 85 postmenopausal women_ based on low (0.14-0.39 mu g/L) or high (0.66-2.1 mu g/L) urinary cadmium_ within a cross-sectional population-based women&#39;s health survey in Southern Sweden. We also measured 25-hydroxy vitamin D. cadmium in blood_ bone mineral density and several markers of bone remodeling and kidney effects. Although there were clear differences in both kidney and bone effect markers between women with low and high cadmium exposure_ the 1_25(OH)(2)D concentrations were not significantly different (median_ 111 pmol/L (5-95th percentile_ 67-170 pmol/L) in low- and 125 pmol/L (66-200 pmol/L) in high-cadmium groups; p = 0.08). Also_ there was no association between 1_25(OH)(2)D and markers of bone or kidney effects. It is concluded that the low levels of cadmium exposure present in the studied women_ although high enough to be associated with lower bone mineral density and increased bone resorption_ were not associated with lower serum concentrations of 1_25(OH)(2)D. Hence_ decreased circulating levels of 1_25(OH)(2)D are unlikely to be the proposed link between cadmium-induced effects on kidney and bone. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Design Cluster sampling cross-sectional survey. All neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)-associated maternity units were recruited (census sampling) in Luxembourg_ the Netherlands and Sweden. In France_ Germany_ Italy_ Spain and the UK_ units were selected at random. In every recruited unit_ all obstetricians with at least 6 months&#39; experience were invited to participate. Setting NICU-associated maternity units in eight European countries. Population Obstetricians with at least 6 months&#39; clinical experience. Methods An anonymous_ self-administered questionnaire was used. Multinomial logistic analysis was used to identify factors predicting the obstetricians&#39; views about modifying the law governing late termination in their country. Main outcome measure Obstetricians&#39; experience of late termination of pregnancy and views about national policies. Results One hundred and five units and 1530 obstetricians participated (response rates 70 and 77% respectively). The most common indications for late termination were congenital anomalies and women&#39;s physical health. Feticide was not common except in France_ Luxembourg and the UK. Active euthanasia of a liveborn was practiced in France and the Netherlands. Obstetricians in Germany were more likely to feel that late termination should be more severely restricted_ the opposite was true in Spain and the Netherlands. In Italy_ there was dissatisfaction with current status_ but opinion was divided_ reflecting views on both sides of the debate. Conclusions This research outlines current practice in a difficult and sensitive area and suggests the need for more discussion and support for all those who were involved.","Late termination of pregnancy: a comparison of obstetricians' experience in eight European countries"

It is equally important to explore involvement of other resources in society_ such as sports associations. This study was designed to investigate the possibility of reducing the degree of obesity in obese children by focusing on physical activity as an intervention. METHODS: Seventy-six children (40 boys) aged 8-12 years (mean age 10.5 years_ mean body mass index (BMI) 28.9_ standard deviation (SD) 3.0; mean BMI z-score 3.24_ SD 0.49) were invited to participate in a one-week sports camp and six-month support system. After the camp a sports coach from a local sports club supported the child during participation in a chosen sport for six months. Weight_ height_ body composition (using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging)_ and lifestyle (using a questionnaire) were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Data were pooled from two camps_ one with a self-selected control group and one randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: Twelve months after the camp the intervention group had a significant decrease in BMI z-score (baseline BMI z-score 3.22; follow up 3.10_ p = 0.023). The control group also reduced their BMI z-score (baseline BMI z-score 3.27; follow up 3.18_ p = 0.022). No differences were found in baseline values_ follow-up values_ or changes in BMI z-score between groups_ nor between boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: The focus on physical activity as an intervention had no effect on degree of obesity when compared with a waiting list control group.","Sports camp with six months of support from a local sports club as a treatment of childhood obesity."

Various excitatory and inhibitory afferent and efferent synapses of the hippocampal CCK basket cells express serotoninergic_ cholinergic_ cannabinoid_ and benzodiazepine sensitive receptors_ all contributing to their functional plasticity. We explored whether CCK basket cells are modulated by neuropeptide Y (NPY)_ one of the major local neuropeptides that strongly inhibits hippocampal excitability and has significant effect on its memory function. Here_ using GAD65-GFP transgenic mice for prospective identification of CCK basket cells and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings_ we show for the first time that excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto CCK basket cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are modulated by NPY through activation of NPY Y2 receptors. The frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs_ as well as the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked EPSCs were decreased. Similarly_ the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature IPSCs_ and the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked IPSCs were decreased after NPY application. Most of the effects of NPY could be attributed to a presynaptic site of action. Our data provide the first evidence that the excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto the CCK basket cells could be modulated by local levels of NPY_ and may change the way these cells process extrahippocampal afferent information_ influencing hippocampal function and its network excitability during normal and pathological oscillatory activities.

The breast cancer cell line L56Br-C1 does not express pRb and is extremely sensitive to treatment with the polyamine analogue N (1)_N (11)-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) which causes apoptosis. Polyamines are essential for the regulation of cell proliferation_ cell differentiation and cell death.

In this study_ L56Br-C1 cells were transfected with human pRb-cDNA. Overexpression of pRb inhibited DENSPM-induced cell death and DENSPM-induced SSAT activity. This suggests that the pRb protein level is a promising marker for polyamine depletion sensitivity and that there is a connection between pRb and the regulation of SSAT activity.

Methods: This study was a randomized control trial_ following the CONSORT statements_ which compared the impact of two interventions. Primary outcome variable was stress_ and secondary outcome variables were caring situation_ general self-efficacy_ well-being_ health_ and quality of life of young informal carers (N = 241). Data were collected in June 2010 to April 2011_ with self-assessment questionnaires_ comparing the two interventions and also to detect changes. Results: The stress levels were high in both groups at baseline_ but decreased in the folder group. The folder group had improvement in their caring situation (also different from the web group)_ general self-efficacy_ well-being_ and quality of life. The web group showed increase in well-being. Conclusion: Young informal carers who take on the responsibility for people close to them; suffer consequences on their own health. They live in a life-situation characterized by high stress and low wellbeing. This signals a need for support. Practice implications: The non-significant differences show that each intervention can be effective_ and that it depends upon the individual&#39;s preferences. This highlights the importance of adopting person-centered approach_ in which young persons can themselves choose support strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It was reported recently that acute psychological stress increases ghrelin gene expression in rat oxyntic mucosa. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of such stress on circulating ghrelin levels. To this end_ we measured plasma ghrelin in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats (a high-anxiety strain) and Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats (a lowanxiety strain)_ exposed to water avoidance stress for 60 min. Blood was collected before and after the stress. Acute stress increased the plasma ACTH concentration similar to 5-fold (p &lt; 0.01) in both strains of rats_ while plasma ghrelin increased by 85% (p &lt; 0.01) in the SPD rats and by 40% (p &lt; 0.001) in the WKY rats. Ghrelin levels after acute stress were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the SPD rats than in the WKY rats. Sham stress did not affect plasma ghrelin. We conclude that acute psychological stress mobilizes ghrelin and that the SPD rats respond with a higher plasma ghrelin concentration than the WKY rats. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

How unique are these properties among yeasts in the Saccharomyces clade_ and what is their origin? Recent progress in genome sequencing has elucidated the phylogenetic relationships among yeasts in the Saccharomyces complex_ providing a framework for the understanding of the evolutionary history of several modern traits. In this study_ we analyzed over 40 yeasts that reflect over 150 million years of evolutionary history for their ability to ferment_ grow in the absence of oxygen_ and generate petites. A great majority of isolates exhibited good fermentation ability_ suggesting that this trait could already be an intrinsic property of the progenitor yeast. We found that lineages that underwent the whole-genome duplication_ in general_ exhibit a fermentative lifestyle_ the Crabtree effect_ and the ability to grow without oxygen_ and can generate stable petite mutants. Some of the pre-genome duplication lineages also exhibit some of these traits_ but a majority of the tested species are petite-negative_ and show a reduced Crabtree effect and a reduced ability to grow in the absence of oxygen. It could be that the ability to accumulate ethanol in the presence of oxygen_ a gradual independence from oxygen and/or the ability to generate petites were developed later in several lineages. However_ these traits have been combined and developed to perfection only in the lineage that underwent the whole-genome duplication and led to the modern Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast.","Fermentative lifestyle in yeasts belonging to the Saccharomyces complex"

However_ a lack of demonstration of the reliability of the process has delayed its large scale industrial implementation. As an important step towards a greater trust in the process reliability_ a self-consistent CFD model has been developed. This paper contains a detailed description of the model and a performance prediction of an entrained flow pilot gasifier for a typical operational condition. Emphasis is put on the modelling of input data for the CFD simulation where eight key assumptions form the basis for a consistent model of the black liquor composition. The results for the pilot gasifier performance with typical values for the design variables indicate that the droplet size should be <200 μm and/or have a residence time of 2-3 s for a high level of carbon conversion.","A self-consisted CFD-model for pressurized high temperature black liquor gasification"

Giving specific attention to relational beeps_ this study analyses the practice through an intersectional theoretical lens_ revealing a practice deeply imbued with social categorical orders. A year of ethnographic study in Uganda (2008) informed this study. Document analyses and twenty-three conversational interviews with friends_ family and acquaintances with whom rapport had been established socio-culturally contextualised the rules associated with the practice prior to qualitative interviews with fifty three university students and recent graduates (20-28). Targeting young dating couples the focus on gender highlights complex rules to the practice that may deter some of the informants in this study from beeping. The same informants basing on other social relationships such as kinships can be found to engage in the same activity. Beeping is therefore a multilayered exercise that each individual at some socio-relational level engages in. It is the relationship to the beep recipient that negotiates this practice. The current study offers as a contribution to existing beeping analyses_ an intersectional understanding of this practice.

The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent sera from patients with IBD contain autoantibodies directed against normal human gastrointestinal mucosa. METHODS: Samples of sera from 50 patients with IBD and 50 healthy subjects were used for immunostaining of normal and affected human gastrointestinal tissues. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the sera from IBD patients showed immunoreactivity against goblet cells in the appendix compared with 8% of the sera from healthy subjects. Goblet cell reactivity of IBD patient sera varied between regions in the gastrointestinal tract. Sera from healthy subjects only reacted with goblet cells in the appendix. In the colon and the appendix_ goblet cell reactivity of IBD sera was generally weak at the base of the crypts and gradually increased toward the lumen. Three IBD sera samples reacted with gastrin cells in the antrum. In colon biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis_ immunoreactivity against the remaining goblet cells showed an inverse correlation with inflammatory activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that immunoreactivity against goblet cells may be of central importance in the pathogenesis of IBD. Identification of goblet cell antigens could lead to a better understanding of IBD and provide a new diagnostic tool.","Immunoreactivity against Goblet cells in patients with inflammatory bowel disease."

Generally_ the image is a convolution between the shape of the tip and the surface. Information of the shape of the probe may be gained by imaging very sharp tips. Here we present a method for making two-dimensional arrays of very sharp tips. The tip arrays were made of silicon using electron beam lithography with subsequent ion-beam etching. To achieve the best possible resolution_ ultrasonic excitation was used during development of the bilayered PMMA resist. Thus_ openings in the resist with size nearly equal to the spot size of the writing e-beam have been obtained. A further decrease of the radius of the tips was obtained by the choice of appropriate thickness for the masking NiCr layer. The tips were conical with a height up to 100 nm with a radius of the tip down to 10 nm. The tips were suitable for study of the shape of AFM probe tips_ under condition that the tip array samples were rinsed in water prior to the measurement.

Using an inadvertent_ whole-ecosystem radiocarbon ((14)C) release in a temperate deciduous oak forest and numerical modeling_ we estimated that the mean age of stored C used to grow both leaf buds and new roots is 0.7 years and about 55% of new-root growth annually comes from stored C. Therefore_ the calculated mean age of C used to grow new-root tissue is similar to 0.4 years. In short_ new roots contain a lot of stored C but it is young in age. Additionally_ the type of structure used to model stored C input is important. Model structures that did not include storage_ or that assumed stored and new C mixed well (within root or shoot tissues) before being used for root growth_ did not fit the data nearly as well as when a distinct storage pool was used. Consistent with these whole-ecosystem labeling results_ the mean age of C in new-root tissues determined using 'bomb-(14)C' in three additional forest sites in North America and Europe (one deciduous_ two coniferous) was less than 1-2 years. The effect of stored reserves on estimated ages of fine roots is unlikely to be large in most natural abundance isotope studies. However_ models of root C dynamics should take stored reserves into account_ particularly for pulse-labeling studies and fast-cycling roots (&lt; 1 years).","Use of stored carbon reserves in growth of temperate tree roots and leaf buds: analyses using radiocarbon measurements and modeling"

Elderly peoples' experience of nursing care after a stroke: from a gender perspective. Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore_ from a gender perspective_ older people's experiences of nursing care after a stroke. Background. Little attention has been given to gender differences in nursing care. The majority of people who have a stroke are older. Improving knowledge of the gender perspectives of older men and women regarding nursing care after stroke is crucial. Method. This was a qualitative study based on interviews with five women and five men between 66 and 75 years of age_ who had received nursing care at a ward for stroke rehabilitation. The data were collected in 2006. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews was carried out. Findings. A main theme and five categories_ all common to both men and women_ were identified. The main theme_ to promote recovery of the body_ encompassed the categories. There were_ however_ gender differences in how the nursing care received was experienced. The ways patients experienced nursing care seemed to be linked with their lives as women and men before they had the stroke. Their perceptions are linked with their lives as women and men before they had their stroke. Both men and women will reclaim former abilities but what they perceive to be the goals of nursing care and rehabilitation may differ. Conclusion. Nurses need to increase their awareness and knowledge concerning the similarities and gender differences in the experiences and needs of older people_ both men and women.","Elderly peoples' experience of nursing care after a stroke"
"oai_DiVA_org_hhs2018_7","This Paper examines monetary cooperation among the Scandinavian central banks during the union period. In 1885_ the Scandinavian Currency Union was strengthened by the adoption of a clearing agreement. The agreement was proposed by the Danish Nationalbank_ with the aim of improving the efficiency of inter Scandinavian monetary transactions. It gave the central banks the right to draw commission free checks on each other. In theory_ this clearing agreement eliminated the gold points among the three Scandinavian countries_ thus maintaining their currencies at par. A further step was taken in 1894 when the Swedish Riksbank and Norges Bank agreed to accept each other's notes at par_ an arrangement joined by the Danish Nationalbank in 1901. This_ however_ marked the high point of Scandinavian monetary cooperation. In 1905 Sweden gave notice of termination of the clearing agreement_ and only after three months of intense negotiations were the three banks able to compromise on a new_ more restrictive_ clearing mechanism. The paper argues that monetary cooperation involved a trade off between financial efficiency and economic vulnerability. It establishes that the cancellation of the original agreement can not be attributed solely to the political conflict between Sweden and Norway that raged in 1905. The Swedish Riksbank had for some time been irritated that the agreement had not been performing the function for which it was originally intended. This irritation_ however_ did not_ reach the point of triggering withdrawal from the agreement_ until Norway dissolved the political union between the two countries. This act increased the risk for the Riksbank of holding part of its gold reserves in the Norwegian national bank and thus served as a catalyst for the renegotiation of the clearing agreement. The new agreement was less efficient_ but also less risky.","Scandinavian monetary cooperation 1873-1914"

The Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R)_ developed by Moss-Morris et al (2002)_ has been widely used in many countries to measure such representations. However_ since studies in this crucial research area are lacking in Sweden a Swedish version of IPQ-R was validated with a focus on the seven subscales: timeline acute/chronic_ timeline cyclical_ consequences_ personal control_ treatment control_ illness coherence and emotional representations. Using confirmatory factor analysis_ the aim of the present study was to validate the internal structure of the Swedish version in a sample of 202 persons (144 men and 58 women) who had been diagnosed with myocardial infarction four months earlier. Additionally_ inter-correlations among the seven subscales and external concurrent validity were also investigated. The results of confirmatory factor analysis revealed that_ in line with the English version of the IPQ-R_ the specified seven-factor model had a satisfactory fit. One item was however not considered reliable and was therefore excluded from the instrument. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coefficients) and the inter-factor correlations were relatively similar to those reported in the validation study of the original English IPQ-R. In tests of concurrent validity_ the seven IPQ-R subscales were_ as hypothesized_ mainly associated with external variables. To conclude_ the Swedish version of the IPQ-R’s seven dimensions_ with one item removed_ (total 37 items) was found to be a reliable and valid measure of illness perception.","Validation of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) in a sample of persons recovering from myocardial infarction – the Swedish version."
"oai_DiVA_org_kth140652_7","This paper proposes a mathematical model for transmission planning in an environment where there is imperfect competition in electricity supply industry. The model is developed based on the concept of the leader-followers game in applied mathematics. The leader of the game is the transmission planner and the followers are the strategic electricity producing firms. The reaction of the strategic electricity producing firms to the transmission planning decision is modeled using the introduced concept of the worst-Cournot-Nash equilibrium. The worst-Cournot-Nash equilibrium can handle the multiple Nash equilibria problem. The whole mathematical formulation is a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem. This formulation is achieved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and a binary mapping approach. The application of the proposed approach to the three-node example system and the modified six-node Garver's example system are studied. The transmission planning with perfect competition is formulated and used as the benchmark. The numerical results show that the proposed approach in this paper can efficiently allocate the additional transmission capacity to the transmission grid such that it reduces the market power cost in the electricity supply industry. However_ further studies should be carried out to scale up the proposed approach to the larger case studies.","Transmission Capacity Expansion in Imperfectly Competitive Power Markets"
"oai_DiVA_org_kau26455_7","Background: Children with chronic conditions or disabilities are at an increased risk for abuse. High-levels of parental stress have been identified as possible trigger for abuse_ where a combination of several factors are of importance_ such as lack of social support and limited resources in the neighborhood. Suggestions for preventive measures have merely focused on parenting strategies and targeted intervention programs. So far_ little attention has been paid to how the risk for abuse might relate to parent’s perceptions of stressors and the role of professionals. The purpose of the current study was therefore to explore risk factors for abuse with focus on both parent-child and parent-professional relationships.Method:Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 15 parents of children with chronic conditions or disabilities were collected and analysed according to qualitative content analysis.Findings:Three major themes were found that could be seen as risk factors for child abuse: 1) Emotional demands in precarious situations between parent and child. 2) Gradual shift in responsibility from professionals to parents concerning access to and coordination of service and support. 3) Emotionally closed environment between professionals and parents and taboo on talking about abuse. The gradual shift in responsibility had emotional implications_ which could reinforce parental stress and thereby also indirect increase the risk of child abuse. The gradual shift in responsibility also seemed to generate an emotionally closed environment and reinforce the taboo on talking about abuse_ which in turn hindered preventive measures. 2Conclusions:In the light of parent’s perceptions of stressors and the role of professionals the findings indicate that abuse against children with chronic conditions or disability is not only a family matter_ but also depending on qualities in service_ professional support and social norms. The result pinpoints three challenges for preventive measures_ all with emotional implications; parental strategies_ organisational efforts and cultural awareness.","Exploring risk for abuse of children with chronic conditions or disabilities"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth144_7","In this thesis the InSb(111)_ InAs(111) and GaSb(001) surfaces have been studied by means of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy based upon the femtosecond laser system. The pump-and-probe technique allows to analyse both electron states in the valence band and normally unpopulated electron states above the valence band_ which can be occupied by transiently excited carriers at the optically pumped surface. The life time of excited carriers is analysed by controlling over the time delay between pump and probe pulses. Experimental studies of the InSb(111) surface and comparison with a previously studied InSb(110) surface show electron excitations in the bulk region with a minor surface contribution. Time-resolved experiments of carrier dynamics at the polar InAs(111)A and InAs(111)B surfaces show about the same life time of excited carriers_ while no populated states above the valence band maximum have been found at the InAs(111)A due to the charge removal. Surface intergap electron states have been found at the GaSb(001) surface located at ~250 meV above the valence band maximum. Angle-resolved experiments showed a strong confinement of this state at the centre of the surface Brillouin zone.A new two dimensional angle-resolved multi-anode analyser for the femtosecond laser photoemission setup has been constructed. The analyser can resolve a cone opening angle of ~1º at a drift distance of ~0.5 m with an energy resolution of ~125 meV.A continuous series of binary system SrTiO3–PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 has been grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on sapphire substrate with crystalline quality control by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The maximum tunability has been tailored to room temperature_ where STO�PZT (71/29) composition shows superior performance. A PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 thin film pressure sensor has been fabricated by PLD and characterised by XRD and electrical measurements. The piezoelectric constant was found to be ~20 % higher compared to the bulk ceramics. A ferroelectric thin film electro-optical cell Na0.5K0.5NbO3/La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (NKN/LSCO) on sapphire has been fabricated by PLD. Refractive indices and electro-optical coefficient of the cell were characterised by prism coupling refractometry. The tunability of the PLD fabricated 2 μm slot NKN thin film interdigital capacitor has been found ~23 % at 40 V bias voltage and frequency 1 MHz.","Electronic materials"

However_ in today's communication scenarios_ user communication and information exchange with (partially) trusted peers is very common_ e.g._ in communication via social applications. When disclosing voluntarily a single observation to a (partially) trusted communication peer_ the user's privacy seems to be unharmed. However_ location data is able to transport much more information than the simple fact of a user being at a specific location. Hence_ a user-centric privacy metric is required in order to measure the extent of exposure by releasing (a set of) location observations. The goal of such a metric is to enable individuals to estimate the privacy loss caused by disclosing further location information in a specific communication scenario and thus enabling the user to make informed choices_ e.g._ choose the right protection mechanism.","Location privacy in relation to trusted peers"

A new shears band was found and linked to the low-lying states in Bi-197. Its dynamic moment of inertia_ F (2)_ is considerably larger than the ((2)) of the shears bands in the neighbouring Pb isotopes. This is probably a result of the involvement of an additional high-K h(9/2) proton orbital.","Shears band with a large dynamic moment of inertia in Bi-197"

Besides rock movements_ the biggest threat to the canister in the repository is corrosion. 'Nature' has proven that copper can last many million of years under proper conditions_ bentonite clay has existed for many million years_ and the Fermoscandia bedrock shield is stable. The groundwater may not stay the very same over very long periods considering glaciations_ but this will not have dramatic consequences for the canister performance. While nature has shown the way_ research refines and verifies. The most important task from a corrosion perspective is to ascertain a proper near-field environment.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth43211_7","Strong mobility enables migration of entire computations combining code_ data_ and execution state (such as stack and program counter) between sites of computation. This is in contrast to weak mobility where migration is confined to just code and data. Strong mobility is essential for many applications where reconstruction of execution states is either difficult or even impossible: load balancing_ reduction of network latency and traffic_ and resource-related migration_ just to name a few. This paper presents a model_ programming abstractions_ implementation_ and evaluation of thread-based strong mobility. The model extends and takes advantage of a distributed programming model based on automatic synchronization through dataflow variables. It comes as a natural extension of dataflow computing which carefully separates issues concerning distribution and mobility. The programming abstractions capture various migration scenarios which differ in how the source and destination site relate to the site initiating migration. The implementation is based on replicating concurrent lightweight threads between sites controlled by migration managers.","Thread-based mobility in Oz"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth4579_7","Today's EDA (Electronic Design Automation) industry faces enormous challenges. Their primary cause is the tremendous increase of the complexity of modern digital designs. Graph algorithms are widely applied to solve various EDA problems. In particular_ graph dominators_ which provide information about the origin and the end of reconverging paths in a circuit graph_ proved to be useful in various CAD (Computer Aided Design) applications such as equivalence checking_ ATPG_ technology mapping_ and power optimization.This thesis provides a study on graph dominators in logic synthesis and verification.The thesis contributes a set of algorithms for computing dominators in circuit graphs. An algorithm is proposed for finding absolute dominators in circuit graphs. The achieved speedup of three orders of magnitude on several designs enables the computation of absolute dominators in large industrial designs in a few seconds. Moreover_ the computation of single-vertex dominators in large multiple-output circuit graphs is considerably improved. The proposed algorithm reduces the overall runtime by efficiently recognizing and re-using isomorphic structures in dominator trees rooted at different outputs of the circuit graph. Finally_ common multiple-vertex dominators are introduced. The algorithm to compute them is faster and finds more multiple-vertex dominators than previous approaches.The thesis also proposes new dominator-based algorithms in the area of decomposition and combinational equivalence checking. A structural decomposition technique is introduced_ which finds all simple-disjoint decompositions of a Boolean function which are reflected in the circuit graph. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art functional decomposition techniques. Finally_ an approach to check the equivalence of two Boolean functions probabilistically is investigated. The proposed algorithm partitions the equivalence check employing dominators in the circuit graph. The experimental results confirm that_ in comparison to traditional BDD-based equivalence checking methods_ the memory consumption is considerably reduced by using the proposed technique.","Dominator-based Algorithms in Logic Synthesis and Verification"

These effects may be reduced by paying attention to modifiers as worker participation and a resonant management style. In this study a participatory approach was used in the food industry in order to improve ergonomics and productivity. The food industry shows a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders_ and repetitive manual work occurs extensively. Prototypes of new packaging solutions were developed in three cases_ and compared in a simulated production to the existing production system through direct measurements of working postures and muscle activity_ ratings of physical load_ and general productivity data. Measured and rated ergonomic exposures showed that workload was significantly lower for the prototypes_ in all three cases. In two cases_ the number of handling operations included in the packaging operations were greatly reduced with the prototype package_ as were production costs. The impact on disorders of the obtained load reductions is difficult to assess_ but we believe that in “critical” situations like this_ even small improvements may have an effect. This study shows that workloads during manual handling of packages as well as production costs can be reduced by applying participative development of packages.","Participative development of packages in the food industry – evaluation of ergonomics and productivity by objective measurements"

However_ due to the nature of computer security there is still a lack of good quantitative assessment methods. Inventing and developing new ways of measuring security are therefore needed in order to more exact describe_ assess_ and improve security of computer environments. One existing quantitative security measure is guesswork. Guesswork gives the average number of guesses in a brute force attack when breaking an encrypted message. In the current definition of guesswork it is assumed that the attacker uses a single processor when breaking an encrypted message. However_ an intelligent and motivated attacker will likely use several processors that can work in parallel to break an encrypted message. This paper formally investigates how guesswork changes over time in multi-processor attacks. The result is applied on three probability distributions_ the English alphabet_ the geometric_ and the truncated geometric to illustrate some behaviors.","Guesswork Changes in Multi-processor Attacks"

Distance bounding protocols allow two wireless devices to securely estimate the distance between themselves_ with the guarantee that the estimate is an upper-bound on the actual distance. These protocols serve as building blocks in security-sensitive applications such as tracking_ physical access control_ or localization.We investigate the resilience of IEEE 802.15.4a to physical-communication-layer attacks that decrease the distance measured by distance bounding protocols_ thus violating their security. We consider two attack types: malicious prover (internal) and distance-decreasing relay (external). We show that if the honest devices use energy-detection receivers (popular due to their low cost and complexity)_ then an adversary can perform highly effective internal and external attacks_ decreasing the distance by hundreds of meters. However_ by using more sophisticated rake receivers_ or by implementing small modifications to IEEE 802.15.4a and employing energy-detection receivers with a simple countermeasure_ honest devices can reduce the effectiveness of external distance-decreasing relay attacks to the order of 10m. The same is true for malicious prover attacks_ provided that an additional modification to IEEE 802.15.4a is implemented.","Distance Bounding with IEEE 802.15.4a"

This coefficient has large implications for_ e.g._ greenhouse gas fluxes but is challenging to quantify in situ. At present_ empirical k-wind speed relationships from a small number of studies and systems are often extrapolated without knowledge of model performance. This study compares empirical k estimates from flux chamber and surface water gas concentration measurements (chamber method)_ eddy cell modeling and dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy (dissipation method)_ and a surface divergence method based on IR imaging_ at a fetch limited coastal observation station. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of the methods_ and relate measured k values to parameters such as wave height_ and surface skin velocities. The chamber and dissipation methods yielded k values in the same order of magnitude over a 24 h period with varying wind conditions (up to 10 m s−1_ closest weather station) and wave heights (0.01–0.30 m). The surface divergence method most likely did not resolve the small turbulent eddies that cause the main divergence. Flux chamber estimates showed the largest temporal variability_ with lower k values than the dissipation method during calm conditions_ where the dissipation method failed as waves and instrument noise dominated over the turbulence signal. There was a strong correspondence between k from chambers_ the RMS of surface velocities from IR imaging_ and wave height. We propose a method to estimate area integrated values of k from wave measurements.","Determination of the piston velocity for water-air interfaces using flux chambers_ acoustic Doppler velocimetry_ and IR imaging of the water surface"

Such machinery is often manually operated_ with each cylinder operating separately. However_ the increased use of microcomputers opens up the possibility of computer control of the motions of all types of manipulator. Such control would facilitate the implementation of end-point-controlled hydraulic-driven manipulators. It could also reduce the learning time for operators and prolong the life of machines. However_ the nonlinear effects of friction in the hydraulic cylinders may be a problem if they disturb the motion of the manipulator arms. There is thus a need to investigate the influence of friction in hydraulic cylinders on manipulator motion.This paper reports on the use of a computer model of a hydraulic-powered manipulator arm to simulate the effects of friction_ as represented in several different friction models_ on the dynamics of a manipulator. The model used was modular and included two hydraulic cylinders_ whose motion was influenced by friction in the cylinders. This model and the work reported in this paper are part of a project to investigate the possibility of implementing end-point control.A simulation with realistic data revealed that in general the friction in the hydraulic cylinders has only a minor effect on the motion of the manipulator arms. However_ very high friction can have a noticeable effect_ particularly if the static friction is much higher than the dynamic friction.","The influence of friction in the hydraulic cylinders on the behaviour of a manipulator"

This entails that tropical cyclones will have a particularly severe impact causing high fatality mostly among the poor people on the costal region. In spite of regular attack of devastating cyclones in Bangladesh coast_ it-s impact on human lives as well as infrastructure and natural resources have been reduced considerably. The damage reduction reached at a level which is now difficult to down further because of two reasons. First is the insufficient information for early preparedness and second is the ineffective after-cyclone damage restoration system. It is therefore especially important in this part of the world that cyclones can be predicted well in advance before landfall. Normally_ cyclone tracking and forecasting is based on satellite images supplemented with data collected using floating buoys_ naval ships_ dropsondes_ airplanes carrying a wide range of active and passive sensors. In Bangladesh however_ there is a lack of supplementary data. Meteorologists in Bangladesh are therefore forced to rely on satellite images only (NOAA-AVHRR). The aim of this project is to assess the informational contents of satellite images and identify their limitations in forecasting tropical cyclones. A first step in the project is to assess to what extent current models used for forecasting around the world are dependent on supplementary data_ and on the other hand to what extent they could be used to predict tropical cyclones using satellite images only.","Cyclone Tracking and Forecasting in Bangladesh Using Satellite Images without Supplementary Data"

In this program the student is to take the role of a journalist at a magazine who is sent on various missions to European countries in order to conduct article research. The journalist is accompanied by a digital pedagogical character in the form of a virtual instructor or a virtual learning companion.After having progressed through the introductory parts of the program_ including a module for choosing a visual character to represent their virtual instructor or learning companion_ the students were (among other things) asked about their views on the idea of using virtual pedagogical characters as an enhancement of learning environment. Furthermore_ they were presented with an option between two digital characters with different communicative styles – one strictly task oriented and one task and relation oriented and were asked to give motives for their choice. The students were also asked to fill out a learning style inventory addressing separate versus connected thinking.The results of the study confirm what has been shown in some other studies_ namely that there are considerable individual differences both in attitudes towards digital characters in digital learning environments and in attitudes towards the social orientation of such characters_ and that these differences in attitudes may be related to various user characteristics. More specifically_ the results of the current study indicate that differences in learning style of the kind assessed in the study belong among those user characteristics.

There are several methods to overcome the problem of shape memory.This study uses a three-layered cross-laminated wood panel where one of the layers is of densified wood and the other two are of normal wood together these will mechanically restrain the shape memory of the densified layer.The study includes three stages:Densification of clear wood in the radial directionManufacture of a three-layered cross laminated composite product with densified wood as a service layerTesting of the shape stability when the composite was subjected to variations relative humidity (40-85 % RH at 20°)The result of this study reveals the significance of service to bottom layer thickness ratio on the shape stability of the cross laminated composite. Consequently_ the performance and the shape stability of the cross laminated composite were significant when the service to bottom layer thickness ratio increases.

"oai_DiVA_org_oru3496_7","Background: Earlier studies have suggested that untreated coeliac disease may be associated with osteoporosis_ but results are contradictory for the risk of long-term fractures.Aim: To study the association between coeliac disease and fractures.Methods: We used Cox regresson to examine the future risk of hip fracture and fracture of any type in more than 13 000 individuals with coeliac disease and 65 000 age- and sex-matched reference individuals in a general population-based cohort.Results: During follow-up_ 1365 first hip fractures and 4847 fractures of any type occurred. Coeliac disease was positively associated with subsequent hip fracture (hazard ratio = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.8-2.4) (in children: hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.1-6.2) and fractures of any type (hazard ratio = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.3-1.5) (in children: hazard ratio = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0-1.2). The absolute excess risk of hip fractures in children with coeliac disease was 4/100 000 person-years. Incidence ratios for hip fracture in individuals with CD were around two both prior to diagnosis of coeliac disease and afterwards; this risk increase remained 20 years after diagnosis of coeliac disease.Conclusions: Individuals with coeliac disease_ including children with coeliac disease_ may be at increased risk of hip fracture and fracture of any type. Coeliac disease may be positively associated with long-term hip fracture risk.","Coeliac disease and the risk of fractures"

"oai_DiVA_org_su16407_7","We can learn something about how large neuronal networks function from models of their spike pattern distributions constructed from data. We do this using the approach introduced by Schneidman et al [1]_ modeling this distribution by an Ising model: P[S] = Z-1exp(ΣJijSiSj + ΣihiSi). In the work reported here_ we explore the accuracy of two algorithms for extracting the model parameters Jij and hi by testing them on data generated by networks in which these parameters are known.Both algorithms use_ as input_ the firing rates and mutual correlations of the neurons in the network. The first algorithm is straightforward Boltzmann learning. It will yield the parameters correctly if the input statistics are known exactly_but it may be very slow to converge. The second_ very fast_ algorithm [2] is based on inversion of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations from spin glass theory. It is derived from a small-Jij expansion_ but it is in principle correct for all Jij when the network is infinitely large and densely connected.In practice_ however_ the rates and correlations used as inputs to the algorithms are estimates based on a finite number of measurements. Therefore_ there will be errors in the extracted model parameters. Errors will also occur if the data are incomplete_ i.e._ if the rates and correlations are not measured for all neurons or all pairs. This case is highly relevant to the experimental situation_ since in practice it is only possible to record from a small fraction of the neurons in a network.Two particular kinds of error statistics are of special interest: variances of the differences between true and extracted parameters_ and variances of the differences between parameters extracted for two independent sets of training data. We study the relation between the two_ since the first is what we are interested in but only the second can be computed in the realistic situation_ where we do not know the parameters a priori. We also examine the variance of the difference between the true and extracted correlations.Finally_ we apply the algorithms to the data of Schneidman et al from salamander retinal ganglion neurons.References--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Conceptual ideas that arise from explorations based upon empirical analysis of situated bi- or multilingual oral talk_ signed talk and literacy communication are presented. The examples used to illustrate the theoretical ideas raised in this article are taken from the literature available on oral_ signed and written communication. Thus the purpose in this paper is to juxtapose analytically derived findings from traditionally segregated fields of study – (hearing) bilingualism_ visually oriented (deaf) bilingualism_ (multilingual) literacies and (hearing so-called) monolingual communication.The analysis of situated or context-bound mundane talk represents a perspective and interest in human communication in terms of meaning making semantic processes that can be distinguished from linguistic analysis of competencies or psychological measurements of cognitive resources or structures or the sociological analysis of attitudes or demographic patterns or analysis of competencies from a handicap or special educational perspective. Focusing social practices – what is communicated by human beings and the ways in which communication occurs – allows_ it is suggested_ for leaving behind a view of language as a static entity or a monological perspective on language.","Meaning making processes in human communication"
"oai_DiVA_org_su24251_7","The CBP protein is a transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase. Reduced expression of Drosophila CBP (dCBP) in the early embryo specifically impairs signaling by the TGF-β molecules Dpp and Screw (Scw). This occurs by a failure to activate transcription of the tolloid (tld) gene_ which codes for a protease that generates active Dpp and Scw ligands. We show that dCBP directly regulates this gene by binding to the tld enhancer_ and that tld expression can be partially rescued with a dCBP transgene. At a slightly later stage of development_ Dpp/Scw signaling recovers in mutant embryos_ but is unable to turn on expression of the Dpp/Scw-target gene rhomboid (rho). Interestingly_ an acetyltransferase (AT)-defective dCBP transgene rescued tld and rho gene expression to an extent comparable to the wild-type transgene_ whereas a transgene containing a 130 amino acid deletion rescued tld but not late rho expression. A tracheal phenotype caused by the reduced dCBP levels was also rescued more efficiently with the wild-type dCBP transgene than with this mutant transgene. Our results indicate that separate parts of the dCBP protein are required on different promoters_ and that the AT activity of dCBP is dispensable for certain aspects of Dpp signaling. We discuss the similarity of these results to the role of p300/CBP in TGF-β signaling in the mouse.","The acetyltransferase activity of Drosophila CBP is dispensable for regulation of the Dpp pathway in the early embryo"

"oai_DiVA_org_su98078_7","During childhood_ infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can occur in close temporal proximity. Active_ as well as latent_ CMV infection is associated with enlarged subsets of differentiated natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells. How EBV infection may influence CMV-driven immune differentiation is not known. We found that EBV coinfection selectively influenced the NK cell compartment of CMV-seropositive (CMV+) children. Coinfected children had significantly higher proportions of peripheral-blood NKG2C(+) NK cells than CMV+ EBV- children. Ex vivo NK cell degranulation after target cell stimulation and plasma IL-15 levels were significantly higher in CMV+ children. EBV coinfection was related to the highest levels of plasma interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-12p70. Remarkably_ in vitro EBV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from EBV- CMV+ children increased NKG2C(+) NK cell proportions. A similar tendency was seen in cocultures of PBMC with EBV+ lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (LCL) and IL-15. After K562 challenge_ NKG2C(+) NK cells excelled in regard to degranulation and production of gamma interferon_ regardless of whether there was previous coculture with LCL. Taken together_ our data suggest that dual latency with these herpesviruses during childhood could contribute to an in vivo environment supporting differentiation and maintenance of distinct NK cell populations. This viral imprint may affect subsequent immune responses through altered distributions of effector cells.","Epstein-Barr Virus Coinfection in Children Boosts Cytomegalovirus-Induced Differentiation of Natural Killer Cells"
"oai_DiVA_org_su982_7","The main aims of this project were to contribute to the knowledge about tropical climate variations_ and to investigate the possibilities of obtaining cosmic ray influx data from stalagmites.Stalagmites from Tanzania and northern South Africa were palaeoclimatologically analysed.U-series dating_ combined with previously published 14C-data (Goslar et al. 2000)_ shows that one of the Tanzanian stalagmites was precipitated during the latter half of the latest glacial_ between approximately 39 and 27 ka. Results from stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ18O) were interpreted as indicating millennial-scale fluctuations in atmospheric CO2-level during that time. These fluctuations show a pattern which is similar to that of the δ18O records from the GRIP and Byrd ice-cores – suggesting that the stalagmite record captures a global climate signal.U-series dating shows that the largest of the South African stalagmites covers most of the last 25 ka. The δ13C- and δ18O-data indicate millennial-scale variation in the South African climate throughout the time of the formation of this stalagmite. Because of similarities to Antarctic records (Steig et al. 2000)_ the driving force for these variations was suggested to be atmospheric circulation changes associated with change in the Southern Hemisphere circumpolar westerly wind vortex. Like the Tanzanian results_ these South African data lend further support to the theory about global persistent millennial-scale climate-fluctuations.A beryllium isotope study was then performed on the two stalagmites described above. This study assesses_ for the first time_ the potential of the cosmogenic isotope 10Be as a tool in stalagmite studies. As a control_ 9Be-analysis was also made on each 10Be-sample.The aim of the study was to test the idea that stalagmites could be a new source of well-dated and directly climate-proxy synchronized information about past variations in cosmic ray influx intensity – i.e._ a source that would serve as a new tool for general improvement of the knowledge about past variations in cosmic ray influx_ and that could possibly also provide further clues to whether such variations can affect Earth’s climate.The main excursions/fluctuations in the 10Be-and 9Be-data from these stalagmites do not coincide. Hence_ the excursions in 10Be-content may be interpreted as indicating excursions in cosmic ray influx. The 10Be-data show three pronounced peaks at around 38_ 35 and 21 ka respectively; plausibly corresponding to the peaks previously observed at approximately 39_ 32 and 23 ka in cosmogenic isotope data from sediments and ice.In glacial parts of the stalagmite material_ the 9Be-concentration fluctuates on a millennial-scale; inversely synchronized with fluctuations in δ13C-data from the same material. This indicates that 9Be could_ apart from being a necessary control for 10Be-results_ also function as a palaeoclimatological proxy in stalagmite studies.In order to improve dating facilities for stalagmites_ a procedure for high-precision measurements of U and Th isotope ratios was also developed_ using an IsoProbe® Multi Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICPMS). The 230Th/232Th ratio for the thorium concentration-standard Alfa Th was determined to 7.96 (±0.012) × 10-7 (2σ)_ and the δ234U obtained for the uranium standard SRM950a was 18.4 ±0.6(2σ). The thorium results show_ that even extremely biased isotope ratios_ in low-concentration samples_ can be measured with remarkably good precision. The quality of each sample measurement can also easily be evaluated. However_ due to repeated technical problems with the instrument_ it has not yet been possible to use the developed procedure for routine analysis and dating of samples.","Studies on Tropical Palaeo-variation in Climate and Cosmic Ray Influx"

A total of 153 cases_ diagnosed a median of 5.3 years after blood donation_ and 271 matched controls were included.

Lack of association was observed in both pre- and postmenopausal women. No correlation was observed between enterolactone and circulating estrogens or SHBG in healthy postmenopausal women.

Data are drawn from the European Social Survey. After using multilevel analysis for 20 European countries_ the paper concludes that neither actual nor perceived size matter for anti-immigrant attitudes in Europe. Nor does size have any effect under different economic or political contexts. This challenges both the theoretical foundation of this specific case of group threat as well as the European political discourse that claims that immigration needs to be reduced in order to lessen tension and_ in the long run_ preserve a stable democracy.","Do Numbers Really Count?

"oai_DiVA_org_uu13160_7","Systematic recent research_ as well as empirical patterns_ suggests that civil conflicts do not take place solely within the confines of state borders. On the contrary_ the probability of conflict on-set appears highly dependent upon conditions and existing conflicts in neighboring states. This study examines ethnically mobilized internal conflict and the conditions under which actors in neighboring states adopt contagious behavior_ through demonstration effects. Three claims are elaborated. First_ it is argued that when ethnic groups gains concessions using armed struggle_ for example through territorial autonomy_ groups in their neighborhood are likely to be inspired to promote their own cause. Secondly_ it is claimed that regardless of the amount of inspiration such demonstration effects provide_ groups are unlikely to challenge their government unless they possess the capabilities required to do so. Third_ it is claimed that the effects of both concessions and group strength should be particularly pronounced if actors in the conflict state share ethnic bonds with groups in neighboring states. These claims are evaluated in preliminary empirical tests_ using global data on the actors involved ethnic conflict in the 1989-2005 period_ e.g. the constituency and bonds these groups have_ concessions gained_ and strength of proximate groups. While the findings regarding the second claim are robust to a number of specifications_ the first claim appears to have less impact of contagion processes. Also_ kinship does seem to matter_ but in ways contrary to expectation. One conclusion drawn from this study is that al-though many researchers have emphasized the risk of demonstration effects_ it may be a rare phenomenon_ happening mainly in particular circumstances and perhaps not originating in inspiration based on political success.","Demonstration Effects and the Contagion of Ethnic Conflict"

As an application we present a simplified derivation of a formula given by de Alfaro and Regge_ in which the quantal normalization integral is expressed in terms of the Jost function. Other applications to integrals involving special functions and to integrals associated with the one-din-tensional Schrodinger equation are also presented. Furthermore_ it is explained why an approximate formula for expectation values is much more accurate than one can expect from the usual_ crude derivation of it_ and why certain attempts to improve that derivation have failed.","A physically important class of integrals expressed as a parameter derivative"

Haplogroup AuB belongs to global lineage M_ and AuA_ AuC_ AuD_ and AuE to N. Within N_ we recognize subdivisions_ assigning AuA to haplogroup S_ AuD to haplogroup 0_ AuC to P4_ and AuE to P8. On available evidence_ (S)AuA and (AuB)-Au-M are widespread in Australia. (AuC)-Au-P4 is found in the Riverine region of western New South Wales_ and was identified by others in northern Australia. (AuD)-Au-O and (AuE)-Au-P8 were clearly identified only from central Australia. Our eight Australian full mt genome sequences_ combined with 20 others (Ingman and Gyllensten [2003] Genome Res. 13:1600-1606) and compared with full mt genome sequences from regions to the north that include Papua New Guinea_ Malaya_ and Andaman and Nicobar Islands_ show that ancestral connections between regions are deep and limited to clustering at the level of the N and M macro-haplogroups. The Australian-specific distribution of the five haplogroups identified indicates genetic isolation over a long period. Ancestral connections within Australia are deeper than those reflected by known linguistic or culturally based affinities. Applying a coalescence analysis to a gene tree for the coding regions of the eight genomic sequences_ we made estimates of time depth that support a continuity of presence for the descendants of a founding population already established by 40_000 years ago.","Mitochondrial genomics identifies major haplogroups in Aboriginal Australians"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu165726_7","Gene content has been shown to contain a strong phylogenetic signal_ yet its usage for phylogenetic questions is hampered by horizontal gene transfer and parallel gene loss and until now required completely sequenced genomes. Here_ we introduce an approach that allows the phylogenetic signal in gene content to be applied to any set of sequences_ using signature genes for phylogenetic classification. The hundreds of publicly available genomes allow us to identify signature genes at various taxonomic depths_ and we show how the presence of signature genes in an unspecified sample can be used to characterize its taxonomic composition. We identify 8_362 signature genes specific for 112 prokaryotic taxa. We show that these signature genes can be used to address phylogenetic questions on the basis of gene content in cases where classic gene content or sequence analyses provide an ambiguous answer_ such as for Nanoarchaeum equitans_ and even in cases where complete genomes are not available_ such as for metagenomics data. Cross-validation experiments leaving out up to 30% of the species show that approximately 92% of the signature genes correctly place the species in a related clade. Analyses of metagenomics data sets with the signature gene approach are in good agreement with the previously reported species distributions based on phylogenetic analysis of marker genes. Summarizing_ signature genes can complement traditional sequence-based methods in addressing taxonomic questions.","Signature genes as a phylogenomic tool"

Here_ we develop a theoretical framework for the interaction of the material's electrons with such intensive_ short radiation pulses. Our theory is based on the time evolution of the electron density matrix_ as defined through the Liouville-von Neumann equation. The latter equation is solved here within the framework of the response theory_ incorporating the perturbing field in higher orders. An analytical tool_ called the order notation_ is developed_ which permits the explicit calculation of the arising nth-order operatorial convolutions. As examples of the formalism_ explicit expressions for several optical phenomena are worked out. Through the developed theory presented here_ two fundamental results are achieved: first_ the perturbing field to higher than linear orders is included in an elegant and compact way_ allowing to treat highly brilliant light_ and_ second_ the complete transient time response on the subfemtosecond scale is analytically provided_ thus dropping the adiabatic approximation commonly made in standard linear response theory.","Beyond linear response theory for intensive light-matter interactions"

Molecular imaging with PET is also increasingly used in drug development_ especially for the determination of drug receptor interaction for CNS-active drugs. This gives the opportunity to relate clinical efficacy to per cent receptor occupancy of a drug on a certain targeted receptor and to relate drug pharmacokinetics in plasma to interaction with target protein. In the present review we will focus on the study of transporters_ such as the monoamine transporters_ the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporter_ the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2_ and the glucose transporter using PET radioligands. Neurotransmitter transporters are presynaptically located and in vivo imaging using PET can therefore be used for the determination of the density of afferent neurons. Several promising PET ligands for the noradrenaline transporter (NET) have been labeled and evaluated in vivo including in man_ but a really useful PET ligand for NET still remains to be identified. The most promising tracer to date is (S_S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2. The in vivo visualization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) may give clues in the evaluation of conditions related to dopamine_ such as Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. The first PET radioligands based on cocaine were not selective_ but more recently several selective tracers such as [11C]PE2I have been characterized and shown to be suitable as PET radioligands. Although there are a large number of serotonin transporter inhibitors used today as SSRIs_ it was not until very recently_ when [11C]McN5652 was synthesized_ that this transporter was studied using PET. New candidates as PET radioligands for the SERT have subsequently been developed and [11C]DASB and [11C]MADAM and their analogues are today the most promising ligands. The existing radioligands for Pgp transporters seem to be suitable tools for the study of both peripheral and central drug–Pgp interactions_ although [11C]verapamil and [18F]fluoropaclitaxel are probably restricted to use in studies of the blood–brain barrier. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is another interesting target for diagnostic imaging and [11C]DTBZ is a promising tracer. The noninvasive imaging of transporter density as a function of disease progression or availability following interaction with blocking drugs is highlighted_ including the impact on both development of new therapies and the process of developing new drugs. Although CNS-related work focusing on psychiatric disorders is the main focus of this review_ other applications of PET ligands_ such as diagnosis of cancer_ diabetes research_ and drug interactions with efflux systems_ are also discussed. The use of PET especially in terms of tracer development is briefly described. Finally_ it can be concluded that there is an urgent need for new_ selective radioligands for the study of the transporter systems in the human brain using PET.","Molecular Imaging of Transporters with Positron Emission Tomography"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu202975_7","Starting from the rigorous excitation equation_ the propagation of waves through a 2D waveguide with the periodically corrugated finite-length insert is examined in detail. The corrugation profile is chosen to obey the property that its amplitude is small as compared to the waveguide width_ whereas the sharpness of the asperities is arbitrarily large. With the aid of the method of mode separation_ which was developed earlier for inhomogeneous-in-bulk waveguide systems [Waves Random Media 2000; 10: 395]_ the corrugated segment of the waveguide is shown to serve as the effective scattering barrier whose width is coincident with the length of the insert and the average height is controlled by the sharpness of boundary asperities. Due to this barrier_ the mode spectrum of the waveguide can be substantially rarefied and adjusted so as to reduce the number of extended modes to the value arbitrarily less than that in the absence of corrugation (up to zero)_ without changing considerably the waveguide average width.","The sharpness-induced mode stopping and spectrum rarefication in waveguides with periodically corrugated walls"

Both techniques confirm the simultaneous presence of open and closed bilayer structures in highly diluted samples as well as the existence of small globular and large elongated micelles at higher concentrations. However_ the two techniques sometimes differ with respect to which type of aggregates is present in a particular sample. In particular_ globular or wormlike micelles are sometimes observed with cryo-TEM in the vicinity of the micelle-to-bilayer transition_ although only bilayers are present according to SANS and the samples appear bluish to the eye. A similar discrepancy has previously been reported but could not be satisfactorily rationalized. On the basis of our comparison between in situ (SANS) and ex situ (cryo-TEM) experimental techniques_ we suggest that this discrepancy appears mainly as a result of the non-negligible amount of surfactant adsorbed at interfaces of the thin sample film created during the cryo-TEM specimen preparation. Moreover_ from our detailed SANS data analysis_ we are able to observe the unusually high amount of free surfactant monomers present in SOS-rich mixtures of SOS and CTAB_ and the experimental results give excellent agreement with model calculations based on the Poisson?Boltzmann mean field theory. Our careful comparison between model calculations and experiments has enabled us to rationalize the dramatic microstructural transformations frequently observed upon simply diluting mixtures of an anionic and a cationic surfactant.","Self-Assembly in Mixtures of an Anionic and a Cationic Surfactant"

In this study we developed a novel percutaneous one-and two-vessel model for chronic myocardial ischemia using a stent coated with a polytetrafluoroethylene tube formed in a bottleneck shape. The bottleneck stent was implanted in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) or proximal circumflex artery (LCX)_ or in both proximal LCX and mid LAD 1 wk later (2-vessel model)_ and pigs were followed for 4-5 wk. Ejection fraction (EF)_ infarct size_ collateral growth_ and myocardial perfusion were assessed. Pigs were given antiarrhythmic medication to prevent sudden death. The occlusion time of the bottleneck stent and the timing of myocardial infarction could be modulated by the duration of antiplatelet medication. Fractional flow reserve measurements and positron emission tomography imaging showed severe ischemia after bottleneck stenting covering over 50% of the left ventricle in the proximal LAD model. Complete coronary occlusion was necessary for significant collateral growth_ which mostly had occurred already during the first wk after the stent occlusion. Dynamic and competitive collateral growth patterns were observed. EF declined from 64 to 41% in the LCX model and to 44% in the LAD model 4 wk after stenting with 12 and 21% infarcted left ventricle in the LCX and LAD models_ respectively. The mortality was 32 and 37% in the LCX and LAD models but very (71%) high in the two-vessel disease model. The implantation of a novel bottleneck stent in the proximal LAD or LCX is a novel porcine model of reversible myocardial ischemia (open stent) and ischemic heart failure (occluded stent) and is feasible for the development of new therapeutic approaches.","The bottleneck stent model for chronic myocardial ischemia and heart failure in pigs"

A theoretical framework of coping strategies can be used to understand how women deal with domestic violence. Traditional values strongly influenced by religious teachings that interpret men as the leaders of women play an important role in the lives of Javanese women_ where women are obliged to obey their husbands. Little is known about how sociocultural and psychosocial contexts influence the ways in which women cope with domestic violence. Objective: Our study aimed to deepen our understanding of how rural Javanese women cope with domestic violence. Our objective was to explore how the sociocultural context influences coping dynamics of women survivors of domestic violence in rural Purworejo. Design: A phenomenological approach was used to transform lived experiences into textual expressions of the coping dynamics of women survivors of domestic violence. Results: Experiencing chronic violence ruined the women's personal lives because of the associated physical_ mental_ psychosocial_ and financial impairments. These chronic stressors led women to access external and internal resources to form coping strategies. Both external and internal factors prompted conflicting impulses to seek support_ that is_ to escape versus remain in the relationship. This strong tension led to a coping strategy that implied a long-term process of moving between actively opposing the violence and surrendering or tolerating the situation_ resembling an elastic band that stretches in and out. Conclusions: Women survivors in Purworejo face a lack of institutional support and tend to have traditional beliefs that hamper their potential to stop the abuse. Although the women in this study were educated and economically independent_ they still had difficulty mobilizing internal and external support to end the abuse_ partly due to internalized gender norms.","'Elastic band strategy'"

To address this question_ this article attempts to set out a new logic for understanding the motives_ nature_ and consequences of corruption in the country. Rather than securing access to a single favor through bribery_ officials invest in political and administrative posts in order to obtain access to stream of rents associated with an office. Political and administrative corruption is organically linked in this system_ and corruption stems not so much from weak monitoring as from being a franchise-like arrangement_ where officials are required to pay continuous fees to their bosses. The key is to be the public official influencing the redistribution of rents as well as participating in the informal market where public goods are privatized and exchanged for informal payments. Thus_ instead of control over the pure economic assets of the state_ influence over the state's institutional and organizational framework is the dominant strategy for earning and investing in the country.","Why are public offices sold in Kyrgyzstan?"

An additional aim was to study associations between parental stress and several explanatory factors in mothers and fathers.Background:The birth of a baby brings many changes to the lives of parents and families. Existing research on gender differences in parental stress levels is somewhat inconclusive.Method:A longitudinal Swedish survey of a one-year cohort of 783 women and 671 male partners recruited in mid pregnancy and followed up one year after birth. Data were collected using three questionnaires where different aspects of stress arising from the parenting role measured by the Swedish Parental Stress Questionnaire (SPSQ) were investigated. Results: Women and men differed in age and level of education. Women had more negative feelings towards pregnancy_ birth and the early parenthood compared to men. Women reported higher levels of parental stress than men in three out of five subscales in the SPSQ (Role Restriction_ Social Isolation and Spouse Relationship). The subscales were moderately correlated with background variables but strongly correlated with prenatal feelings. Prenatal negative feelings about the pregnancy_ the upcoming birth and the first weeks with a newborn baby were strongly correlated with parental stress for both mothers and fathers.Conclusion:Assessing parents' feelings and prenatal attitudes is important for understanding parental stress one year after birth. Health care providers should discuss these issues with both parents during pregnancy in order to help them cope with the normal stresses of parenting.","Parental stress in mothers and fathers one year after birth"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu223518_7","During the Middle Ordovician cephalopods became an important part of the macrofauna of the Baltoscandian carbonate platform. The earliest cephalopod abundance peak was reached during the early Darriwilian_ within the Kunda Stage Yangtzeplacognathus crassus and Lenodus pseudoplanus conodont zones. In sediments of this time interval large orthoconic cephalopods often occur in masses with more than one specimen per square-meter on bedding surfaces. The assemblages are characterized by the strong dominance of often large endocerids. In proximal depositional settings coiled tarphycerids and other cephalopod groups are an important additional component. In the most distal settings orthocerids are the most important secondary component. Correspondence Analysis of assemblages throughout Baltoscandia revealed three distinct biofacies_ which here are termed Orthocerid_ Proterovaginoceras and Anthoceras Biofacies_ respectively. The biofacies reflect differences in depth and proximity to the shoreline and are consistent with the Baltoscandian Confacies Belts. Spatial changes in absolute abundance and taxonomic composition indicate increased original cephalopod population densities and habitat expansion within the Y.crassus and L.pseudoplanus conodont zones. A nearly coeval abundance peak in a similar facies in South China indicates supraregional causes of the mass occurrence_ probably reflecting a globally increased nutrient availability in the water column during the Darriwilian.","Middle Ordovician cephalopod biofacies and palaeoenvironments of Baltoscandia"

Improvement in bypass techniques and various adjunctive measures has reduced its incidence_ but still 5-10 % of the patients develop postoperative paraplegia. There is no universally accepted method for the detection of spinal cord ischemia. Intraoperative monitoring methods are important for the prediction of ischemia and guidance in aorticreplacement strategy. This thesis presents a new technique for continuous peroperative monitoring of intrathecal oxygenation.A multiparameter sensor was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PO2_ PCO2 and pH during thoracic aortic cross-clamping in pigs. The findings were experimentally validated by comparisons with epidural laser-Doppler flowmetry and with morphological outcome_ as assessed by electron microscopy of immersion fixated spinal cord specimens. The CSF monitoring was used to study functional aspects of segmental and collateral spinal cord blood supply. An experimental model was developed for the study of selective spinal cord ischemia. For this purpose a passive aortic shunt was used.The new monitoring method correlated in the experimental situation with measurements of microcirculation and changes in spinal cord ultrastructure associated with aortic cross-clamping. It proved to be sensitive for detecting ischemia and responded rapidly to alterations in spinal cord circulation. The confounding hemodynamic effects of cross-clamping and systemic reperfusion injuries to the spinal cord could be avoided in the selective ischemia model. The shunt model was also used to study the beneficial effects of hyperoxemia during spinal cord hypoperfusion. In conclusion_ this thesis presents a new monitoring method for spinal cord oxygenation during experimental aortic occlusion. The thin flexible sensor can be used percutaneously in humans and comparative studies are needed to correlate the findings with neurophysiological evaluations and clinical outcome.","Spinal cord ischemia"

"oai_DiVA_org_uu95461_7","Using expressed sequence tag (EST) data for genomewide studies requires thorough understanding of the nature of the problems that are related to handling these sequences. We investigated how EST clustering performs when the genome is used as guidance as compared to pairwise sequence alignment methods. We show that clustering with the genome as a template outperforms sequence similarity methods used to create other EST clusters_ such as the UniGene set_ in respect to the extent ESTs originating from the same transcriptional unit are separated into disjunct clusters. Using our approach_ approximately 80% of the RefSeq genes were represented by a single EST cluster and 20% comprised of two or more EST clusters. In contrast_ approximately 25% of all RefSeq genes were found to be represented by a single cluster for the UniGene clustering method. The approach minimizes the risk for overestimations due to the amount of disjunct clusters originating from the same transcript. We have also investigated the quality of EST-data by aligning ESTs to the genome. The results show how many ESTs are not adequately trimmed in respect of vector sequences and low quality regions. Moreover_ we identified important problems related to ESTs aligned to the genome using BLAT_ such as inferring splice junctions_ and explained this aspect by simulations with synthetic data. EST-clusters created with the method are available upon request from the authors.","Evaluation of EST-data using the genome assembly"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu795_7","Throughout the past century the concept of an inverted perspective_ understood as a stylistic trait in Late Classical_ Byzantine and Medieval art_ has been at the centre of a controversy. The dissertation aims at giving a favourable presentation of "inverted perspective" as a critical concept with a fairly well-defined frame of reference_ although efforts to make such a definition a reductionist_ fixed meaning tied to a stable system of Geometrical optics will be regarded as unnecessary. Instead_ the concept with its various_ diverging meanings is understood as a vehicle_ which might be sharpened and defined through its specific use in the process of interpreting a work of art. The concept is articulated through close reading and critical dialogue with actual users of the concept_ or more or less related concepts. In the first part_ the roots of a controversy are found in the conflict between critical assessments of spatial values in Byzantine and Medieval art_ and an incorrect idea of evolution in art and visual perception. Secondly_ rhetorical uses of perspective devices are contrasted with perspective analysis based on the central projection through a plane. Here_ a genuine conflict is located_ as the assessment of an inverted perspective element tends to make perspective theory too complex to be handled in simple models_ thereby weakening its explanative power. The third part discusses various ways of understanding perspective and inverted perspective as mediating between pictorial art and perception. The usefulness of the concept of an inverted perspective is demonstrated through a number of critical discussions of paintings from different epochs and countries. Finally_ this constitutes the origin of the concept in a prevailing basic operation of perspective analysis_ reasonably termed "inverted perspective".","Omvänt perspektiv i bildkonst och kontrovers"
"oai_DiVA_org_uu79992_7","CONTEXT: Diabetes and obesity are established risk factors for congestive heart failure (CHF) and are both associated with insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: To explore if insulin resistance may predict CHF and may provide the link between obesity and CHF. DESIGN_ SETTING_ AND PARTICIPANTS: The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men_ a prospective_ community-based_ observational cohort in Uppsala_ Sweden. We investigated 1187 elderly (&gt;or=70 years) men free from CHF and valvular disease at baseline between 1990 and 1995_ with follow-up until the end of 2002. Variables reflecting insulin sensitivity (including euglycemic insulin clamp glucose disposal rate) and obesity were analyzed together with established risk factors (prior myocardial infarction_ hypertension_ diabetes_ electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy_ smoking_ and serum cholesterol level) as predictors of subsequent incidence of CHF_ using Cox proportional hazards analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: First hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: One hundred four men developed CHF during a median follow-up of 8.9 (range_ 0.01-11.4) years. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for established risk factors for CHF_ increased risk of CHF was associated with a 1-SD increase in the 2-hour glucose value of an oral glucose tolerance test (hazard ratio [HR]_ 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]_ 1.08-1.93)_ fasting serum proinsulin level (HR_ 1.29; 95% CI_ 1.02-1.64)_ body mass index (HR_ 1.35; 95% CI_ 1.11-1.65)_ and waist circumference (HR_ 1.36; 95% CI_ 1.10-1.69)_ whereas a 1-SD increase in clamp glucose disposal rate decreased the risk (HR_ 0.66; 95% CI_ 0.51-0.86). When adding clamp glucose disposal rate to these models as a covariate_ the obesity variables were no longer significant predictors of subsequent CHF. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance predicted CHF incidence independently of established risk factors including diabetes in our large community-based sample of elderly men. The previously described association between obesity and subsequent CHF may be mediated largely by insulin resistance.","Insulin resistance and risk of congestive heart failure"

The networks were used to identify potentially suboptimal or erroneous interpretations of myocardial perfusion scintigrams (MPS). Methods: Reversible perfusion defects (ischaemia) in each of five myocardial regions_ as interpreted by one experienced nuclear medicine physician during his daily routine of clinical reporting_ were assessed by artificial neural networks in 316 consecutive patients undergoing stress/rest 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. After a training process_ the networks were used to select the 20 cases in each region that were more likely to have a false clinical interpretation. These cases_ together with 20 control cases in which the networks detected no likelihood of false clinical interpretation_ were presented in random order to a group of three experienced physicians for a consensus re-interpretation; no information regarding clinical or neural network interpretations was provided to the re-evaluation panel. Results: The clinical interpretation and the re-evaluation differed in 53 of the 200 cases. Forty-six of the 53 cases (87%) came from the group selected by the neural networks_ and only seven (13%) were control cases (P &lt; 0.001). The disagreements between clinical routine interpretation by an experienced nuclear medicine expert and artificial networks were related to small and mild perfusion defects and localization of defects. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that artificial neural networks can identify those myocardial perfusion scintigrams that may have suboptimal image interpretations. This is a potentially highly cost-effective technique_ which could be of great value_ both in daily practice as a clinical decision support tool and as a tool in quality assurance.","Use of neural networks to improve quality control of interpretations in myocardial perfusion imaging"

Soil leachate (SI_ the soil solution in macropores which is freely drained from forest floor after rainfall)_ the soil matrix solution (SMS_ the soil solution in meso-/micropores of the soil matrix)_ and soil water extracts (SWE) from two different beech forest floors were compared. Zero-tension and tension lysimeters were used to collect SL and SMS_ respectively. Loss of DOC (during 21 days) and respiration of CO2-C (during 7 days) were used as conventional measures of the availability of DOC. Bacterial production_ measured using the leucine incorporation technique_ and bacterial growth efficiency were also estimated. All methods were used to study differences in biodegradability between plots with and without ground flora (Deschampsia flexuosa or Anemone nemorosa) and different type of forest floor (with an organic (O) horizon or a mull (A) horizon). There were no differences in bioavailability of DOC from soil solutions extracted from plots with and without ground flora. The bioavailability of DOC in the different collected soil solutions varied_ however. DOC in SWE was the most available_ with a mean of 39% of DOC-loss in 21 days_ and 18% of DOC being respired in 7 days. DOC in soil matrix solution was the least available of the soil solutions (7% respired)_ significantly less than DOC in soil leachate (11% respired). The methods measuring biodegradation of DOC_ DOC-loss and CO2-C respiration gave similar results and were comparable to bacterial production and bacterial growth efficiency_ with the exception of SWE from the O-horizon at the a flexuosa site_ which had low bacterial production and bacterial growth efficiency_ indicating a limitation of the bacterial growth.

Emulsions were characterised with respect to droplet size_ interfacial tension_ creaming_ surface load and electron microscopy. The effects of pH and thylakoid concentration were also considered. Droplet size decreased with increasing thylakoid concentration_ reaching a plateau around 15 µm beyond concentrations of 2 mg protein mL(-1) oil. The resulting emulsions were stable against coalescence but were subject to creaming. The surface pressure (air/water interface) of the thylakoid isolate was 44 mN m(-1) and the surface load 13 mg m(-2) at 10 mg protein mL(-1) oil. Electron micrographs showed thylakoids adsorbed as bunched vesicles on the drop surfaces. The stabilisation mechanism can be described as a combined effect of surface-active molecules_ mainly membrane proteins but also membrane lipids_ exposed on surfaces of thylakoid membrane vesicles adsorbed as particles.CONCLUSION: Thylakoid membranes effectively stabilise oil-in-water emulsions_ which should facilitate their incorporation in food with satiety-promoting effects.

A feature of endothelial dysfunction is an increased expression of arterial vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET) and angiotensin (AT) receptors. Our aim was to investigate if the arterial expressions of these receptors are changed in patients with suspected but ruled out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Small subcutaneous arteries (diameter of 100 A mu m) were surgically removed in an abdominal biopsy from 12 patients suspicious of ACS (susp ACS)_ admitted to the medical telemetry unit for chest pain. The vessels were analyzed for their receptor protein expression by quantitative immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies directed against ETA_ ETB_ AT(1)_ and AT(2) receptors. The control group (controls) consisted of eight healthy volunteers matched for age and sex with no previous cardiac illness or medication. The susp ACS group had an increased expression of ETB (by 94%) and AT(1) (by 34%) receptors in the smooth muscle cells of resistance arteries as compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in AT(2) and ETA receptor expression between the groups. The results indicate that the expression of arterial smooth muscle ETB and AT(1) receptors are increased in patients with suspected but ruled out ACS. These receptor changes could be important in the regulation of coronary tone and in the development of atherosclerosis_ and may be related to increased cardiovascular risk.","Increased expression of endothelin ETB and angiotensin AT(1) receptors in peripheral resistance arteries of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome"

Breaking of immunological tolerance will lead to autoimmune disease or chronic inflammatory conditions. T cell maturation in the thymus generates a peripheral T cell pool with an enormous TCR repertoire_ from which specific T cells are selected and activated upon encounters with pathogens. However_ potentially autoaggressive T cells are also produced by the thymus. In order to prevent these autoreactive T cells from causing disease_ the immune system has evolved several distinct mechanisms by which they are regulated. Recently_ it has become apparent that regulatory T cells are crucial for the maintenance of self-tolerance. One such population of regulatory T cells_ the CD4+CD25+ T cells_ has been shown to regulate the induction of various autoimmune diseases. CD4+CD25+ T cells also suppress activation-induced proliferation of CD4+CD25- T cells in vitro. The aim of this thesis is to find out how CD4+CD25+ T cells function in vitro. We present data showing that the CD4+CD25+ T cell-mediated suppression of CD4+CD25- T cells in vitro_ is strictly dependent on the presence of antigen-presenting cells. Moreover_ we show that CD4+CD25+ T cells down-modulate the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells. We also demonstrate that the down-modulation of CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells is sufficient for inhibiting the proliferation of CD4+CD25- T cells. Furthermore_ we found that the down-modulation of CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells is mediated by CD152 expressed by the CD4+CD25+ T cells. Together these data suggest that one major mechanism by which CD4+CD25+ T cells suppress proliferation of CD4+CD25- T cells in vitro_ is by a CD152-mediated down-modulation of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells.","Studies on the function of CD4CD25 regulatory T cells: An in vitro approach"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_41968_7","Immunsystemet består av en specifik och en ospecifik del som samarbetar när ett immunsvar sätts igång. Den specifika delen utgörs av T och B celler som med specifika ytreceptorer_ så kallade antigen-receptorer_ känner igen och aktiveras av främmande ämnen (antigen). För att T celler skall aktiveras av antigen_ krävs det att dendritiska celler inom den ospecifika delen av immunsystemet plockar upp och bryter ner antigenet så att det kan kännas igen av T cellernas antigen-receptorer. Specificiteten hos dessa antigen-receptorer bildas slumpmässigt vilket gör att ingen T cell är den andra lik med avseende på antigen-receptor. Detta leder också till att den sammantagna antigen-receptor uppsättningen hos en enskild individ är näst intill oändligt stor. Därför kan också immunsystemet reagera specifikt på i stort sett vilket antigen som helst. Risken med att generera antigen receptorer slumpmässigt är att det kan bildas T och B celler med antigen-receptorer som är specifika mot självantigen. Faktum är att alla normala friska individer bildar självspecifika T och B celler. Dessa självspecifika celler skulle därför kunna sätta igång immunsvar som är riktade mot individens egna organ. För att förhindra detta är immunsystemet utrustat med olika reglerande mekanismer. När dessa reglerande mekanismer fallerar uppstår autoimmuna sjukdomar. Detta är kroniska inflammatoriska sjukdomar_ till exempel Multipel Scleros (MS) eller reumatism_ som sakta men säkert förstör det organ som är angripet. Insulinberoende diabetes (IDDM) är ett annat exempel. I detta fall förintar immunsystemet de insulinproducerande cellerna i bukspottskörteln redan vid ung ålder. På senare tid har det blivit uppenbart att funktionen hos en särskild grupp T celler_ utgör en viktig mekanism för att förhindra uppkomsten av autoimmuna sjukdomar. Dessa T celler kallas regulatoriska T celler och experiment utförda i försöksdjur har visat att de regulatoriska T cellernas funktion är just att förhindra de naturligt förekommande självspecifika T cellerna från att orsaka autoimmuna sjukdomar. Syftet med denna avhandling är att förstå hur regulatoriska T celler fungerar. Därför har vi studerat hur regulatoriska T celler kontrollerar andra T celler i cell kultur. Eftersom samarbetet mellan T celler och dendritiska celler är avgörande för att immunsvar skall kunna inledas har vi särskilt studerat hur dendritiska celler påverkas av regulatoriska T celler. Det främsta fyndet i denna avhandling är att regulatoriska T celler kan förhindra andra T celler från att aktiveras genom att stänga av den stimulerande förmågan hos dendritiska celler. Vi har också identifierat de cellmembran proteiner som regulatoriska T celler använder sig av för att påverka dendritiska celler. Interaktionen mellan regulatoriska T celler och dendritiska celler leder till en nedreglering av andra cell membran proteiner hos dendritiska celler som är avgörande för att dendritiska celler skall kunna aktivera T celler. Kunskap om hur regulatoriska T celler förhindrar uppkomst av autoimmuna sjukdomar_ tillsammans med andra reglerande mekanismer_ är grundläggande för utveckling av mer specifika läkemedel mot autoimmuna sjukdomar_ eftersom detta kan öppna möjligheter för att stimulera och kontrollera dessa celler hos patienter med kroniska inflammatoriska sjukdomar.","Studies on the function of CD4CD25 regulatory T cells: An in vitro approach"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_421761_7","The aim of this paper is to analyse the role that the Japanese Government has played in the development of alternatives to conventional vehicles_ the effect of government programmes_ and the importance of technical flexibility in government support schemes. The focus is on battery-powered electric vehicles (BPEVs)_ hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)_ and fuel cell electric vehicles. The effects of government policy and the process of innovation are analysed from a systems approach drawing on the literature regarding technical change and innovation. The whole chain of government support_ including the context in which these different policies have been implemented since the early 1970s_ is studied. The Japanese Government has adopted a comprehensive strategy including R&amp;D_ demonstration programmes and market support guided by long-term strategic plans. The role of the Government has been that of a conductor in the development process supplying both R&amp;D support and artificially created niche markets_ and easing the way for targeted technologies by means of legislation and standards. Despite this_ the targeted technology (the BPEV) has not been established on the market. However_ the recent market success of the HEV can partly be attributed to the government support of the BPEV technology. The enabling component_ the electric drivetrain_ was developed for automotive use within the BPEV programmes offered by the MITI. This technology was later utilised in the HEV. The history of BPEVs in Japan demonstrates that &quot;picking winners&quot; in government policy is not easy. Despite a sustained and ambitious policy by the MITI_ the development of alternative vehicles never unfolded according to plan. The success factors for policy seem more related to technology specific features than the particular policy style. Our conclusion is that flexibility_ adaptability and cooperation in terms of technical choice is necessary in policy. This increases the chances of a technology surviving the long journey from idea to competitive technology. Another conclusion is that market support_ even in the early phases of development_ is an important complement to R&amp;D for gaining experience and building markets.","Government policy and the development of electric vehicles in Japan"

"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_4291573_7","The morphogenesis of organs necessarily involves mechanical interactions and changes in mechanical properties of a tissue. A long standing question is how such changes are directed on a cellular scale while being coordinated at a tissular scale. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical cues are participating in the control of growth and morphogenesis during development. We introduce a mechanical model that represents the deposition of cellulose fibers in primary plant walls. In the model both the degree of material anisotropy and the anisotropy direction are regulated by stress anisotropy. We show that the finite element shell model and the simpler triangular biquadratic springs approach provide equally adequate descriptions of cell mechanics in tissue pressure simulations of the epidermis. In a growing organ_ where circumferentially organized fibers act as a main controller of longitudinal growth_ we show that the fiber direction can be correlated with both the maximal stress direction and the direction orthogonal to the maximal strain direction. However_ when dynamic updates of the fiber direction are introduced_ the mechanical stress provides a robust directional cue for the circumferential organization of the fibers_ whereas the orthogonal to maximal strain model leads to an unstable situation where the fibers reorient longitudinally. Our investigation of the more complex shape and growth patterns in the shoot apical meristem where new organs are initiated shows that a stress based feedback on fiber directions is capable of reproducing the main features of in vivo cellulose fiber directions_ deformations and material properties in different regions of the shoot. In particular_ we show that this purely mechanical model can create radially distinct regions such that cells expand slowly and isotropically in the central zone while cells at the periphery expand more quickly and in the radial direction_ which is a well established growth pattern in the meristem.","Stress and strain provide positional and directional cues in development."

More specifically_ it examines whether changes in the number of innovations_ the character of the innovating firms_ and the distribution of innovations across industries are generally associated with any such period. Significant differences in received accounts of structural transformation in the Swedish manufacturing sector motivate the study. A newly compiled database containing observations of nearly 4000 innovations is explored. It is found that innovation output is at its greatest during the economically stagnant period running from 1975 and until the first years of the 19 80s. Furthermore_ innovations produced in this period are more novel than those of any other period. Innovation output observed in the relatively prosperous period 1994-2007 is meager and generally less novel. There is a marked increase in small firm innovation; from the early 1980s onwards_ small firms are the most important source of innovation. The increase cuts through the entire period and stands in contrast with the economically important role traditionally considered to be played by large firms in the Swedish economy. Innovation output is found to shift from being primarily achieved in the capital goods sector to being subsequently developed in fields such as instruments_ telecom products_ and software. With regard to the revolutionary growth of microelectronics characterizing the period_ the Swedish manufacturing sector is found to be competent in implementing such technology and to be primarily a receiver rather than a supplier of microelectronic components.","Innovation and transformation in the Swedish manufacturing sector_ 1970-2007"

The growing competition existent puts high demands on the electric system as well as the rest of the vehicle. As a consequence_ substantial design effort is devoted to optimize both at system and component level_ with respect to different parameters such as fuel efficiency_ power density_ cost and reliability. As bidirectional energy converters between electric and mechanical energy_ electrical machines play an essential role inside electric or hybrid drivelines. The performance of the electrical machine has a high impact on the overall traction system_ and therefore a thorough machine design is crucial for a successful electric driveline. This thesis describes in detail the design process of an electric traction machine for a particular HEV application_ an Electric Rear Wheel Drive (E-RWD) unit. The evolution of the design is presented_ analyzing the effect of the different driving forces at the different stages. Throughout the thesis it is seen that a modest change on the initial specifications set can lead to a significantly different solution. For this reason_ a minimum set of initial specifications is proposed_ together with a new design methodology based on the description of the load profile in the form of driving cycles. The manufacturing of a prototype and the experimental validation of the design are also covered in this work. The proposed traction machine is tested standalone_ as well as integrated in the E-RWD unit onboard the vehicle. From the experience gained both from the design and the experimental testing phases_ it appears that the performance of the machine is usually limited by its thermal capabilities. Improving the cooling conditions allows to operate the machine at higher power levels_ which has a direct influence on the outcome of the design process. A way to enhance the cooling capabilities for conventional radial flux machines is investigated. Moreover_ a machine design with a completely novel cooling concept based on direct cooling of laminated stator windings is presented_ and its thermal characteristics are extensively analyzed.","Electric Traction Machine Design for an E-RWD Unit"
"oai_lup_lub_lu_se_4353279_7","Since the first generation of the Toyota Prius was first introduced in December 1997_ the number of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and pure Electric Vehicles (EVs) available in the market has increased substantially_ and nowadays almost every car manufacturer has at least one HEV or even EV model within their range. The reason behind this trend relies on the increased concern over the limited availability of fossil fuels together with the now well documented effect of the gases resulting from their combustion onto the atmosphere_ which leads to a transition towards alternative renewable energy sources_ not least in transport applications. Electrical machines play an essential role inside electric or hybrid drivelines. As a bidirectional energy converter between electric and mechanical energy_ all the power coming either to or from the electric energy source must be converted in the electrical machine. It is then obvious that the performance of the electrical machine has a high impact on the overall traction system_ and therefore a thorough machine design is crucial for a successful electric driveline. This thesis describes in detail the design process of an electric traction machine for a certain HEV application_ an Electric Rear Wheel Drive (ERWD) unit. The requirements associated with this particular application are analyzed_ and a new design methodology is developed in order to find the optimal electric traction machine for it. As the design work progresses_ it becomes more and more apparent that a good thermal design is at least as important as a good electromagnetic design_ especially for the application considered. Besides_ the thermal and the electromagnetic design tasks are not independent. Conversely_ there is actually a high level of interdependence between them_ and therefore both need to be solved simultaneously. As opposed to traditional industrial applications_ the load profile of an electric traction machine is highly dynamic_ depending on the driver&#39;s requirements and the external driving conditions. Usually_ an optimal machine for this application should be able to operate over the rated power (torque and/or speed) for a significant amount of time_ and this is only possible with an outstanding thermal design. In addition_ the thesis also covers several practical aspects related to the manufacturing of electrical machine prototypes and the experimental tests of such in the laboratory.","Electric Traction Machine Design for an E-RWD Unit"

The proportions of MCI/MI are 3:1. MI alone has been used as a preservative in occupational and household products_ and cosmetics since less than 10 years. MCI/MI tested at 100 ppm fails to detect a significant percentage of contact-allergic reactions to MI. Our aim was to investigate whether a separate test preparation with MI picks up additional cases of contact allergy to MI not detected with MCI/MI 200 ppm. MI was inserted into the baseline series of the Malmö clinic in 2003 starting at 475 ppm_ then 900 ppm_ then 1_000 ppm_ 1_500 ppm and finally 2_000 ppm. In 5_881 consecutively tested dermatitis patients the contact allergy rate for MI varied between 0.5 and 6.5%_ with a marked increase in recent years. The contact allergy rate to MI 2_000 ppm alone_ not traced by MCI/MI 200 ppm_ varied between 0 and 1.9%. In conclusion_ due to the increase of contact allergy to MI not traced by MCI/MI 200 ppm_ MI in water at 2_000 ppm should be tested in a baseline series. Independent of patch test technique a dose of 60 µg/cm should not be exceeded to avoid adverse reactions and particularly patch test sensitisation.","Methylisothiazolinone Contact Allergy is Rising to Alarming Heights Also in Southern Sweden."

Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted an in-depth_ systematic literature review and multilevel analysis of 82 selected articles. In the analysis_ the authors investigated: whether the articles applied the supply chain as the unit of analysis; the selected research method; whether the articles applied the supply chain as the unit of data collection (i.e. collected data from three or more different companies); and finally_ aspects of information sharing – including benefits. Findings – Despite anecdotal descriptions of benefits from information sharing in supply chains_ the authors could not find empirical evidence to support these claims. Rather_ the main body of literature reports on a focal company&#39;s perspective on traditional buyer-supplier relationships. Research limitations/implications – Given the lack of evidence for the claimed benefits of information sharing on a supply chain level_ more research is needed in this field. The authors therefore propose an agenda for future research building on four key points. Originality/value – Contrary to popular belief_ empirical evidence for benefits of information sharing in supply chains does not seem to exist.

A selection of ball nose end mills in combination with two different tool steels (hardness 39 and 47 HRC) were used to manufacture the surfaces that were to be measured. It was found that using an appropriate measuring strategy it is possible to measure the roughness of these relatively smooth surfaces (0.1&lt;1µm) with satisfactory accuracy using a handheld profiler. However_ it was also found that_ in contrast to what is common practice_ Ra is not a suitable parameter to use for evaluation. Instead_ using Rz or Rp is suggested.

"oai_DiVA_org_his1670_7","The virulence determinants of Staphylococcus aureus are expressed in a growth phase-dependent manner governed by the autoinducible quorum-sensing system agr. Activation of the agr system results in a rapid increase in the regulator RNAIII and occurs in response to accumulation of AIP. In order to activate the agr system_ a basal transcription of agr components must be assumed. This basal transcription of agr components seems to be stimulated by sarA. To better understand how SarA would affect activation of the agr system by modulating the basal agr activity_ a mathematical model for autoactivation of the agr system was set up. The model predicted that the agr system is hysteretic_ meaning that the agr system is activated at a specific concentration of autoinducing peptide (AIP)_ whereas it is inactivated at a specific lower concentration of AIP. According to the model_ changing the basal agr activity only had a marginal effect on steady-state levels of RNAIII but changed the sensitivity of the cells to AIP. This was supported by Northern blot analysis of RNAIII in S. aureus mutants with different levels of SarA expression. Since natural antagonistic AIPs have been demonstrated_ the effect of adding inhibitors to the system was analyzed.","Characterizing the Dynamics of the Quorum-Sensing System in Staphylococcus aureus"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth104598_7","Extremum seeking control was originally proposed for adaptive optimization of static systems and later extended to Hammerstein and Wiener systems. More recently_ stability and convergence results were presented also for general type dynamic systems with a focus on the local behavior around the optimum and under assumptions of relatively slow gradient estimation and control. In this paper we derive properties characterizing any stationary solution of the extremum seeking control scheme_ i.e._ we do not restrict ourselves to solutions close to optimum and allow for any frequency in the sinusoidal perturbation based gradient estimation scheme. By considering the linear properties around a stationary solution of the system_ we show that stationary solutions are characterized by either a zero gradient or a phase lag condition. The former condition is satisfied at the optimum only for systems in which the zero gradient at the optimum is due to a static nonlinearity. The phase lag condition is shown to be satisfied close to the optimum for low frequency excitations_ but can also be satisfied at solutions arbitrarily far from the optimum. The results imply that the extremum seeking control scheme applied to general type dynamic systems can have multiple stable stationary solutions of which some are sub-optimal and potentially far removed from the optimum. For illustration we consider extremum seeking control of a tubular bioreactor_ displaying a maximum yield_ and show that the closed-loop has two saddle-node bifurcations resulting in a total of three possible stationary solutions for some perturbation frequencies. A stable sub-optimal solution_ with a yield less than 10% of the optimal yield_ exists even with relatively slow gradient estimation.                       ","Multiple stationary solutions to the extremum seeking control problem"

Effects on congestion reduction were larger than anticipated_ which also resulted in favourable economic and environmental effects.

Such dams have rarely been constructed in crystalline rock areas and to best of our knowledge_ geographic information system (GIS) has never been used in any methodology for locating suitable sites for constructing these dams. This paper presents a new methodology to locate suitable sites for the construction of subsurface dams using GIS software supported by groundwater balance modelling in a study area Boda-Kalvsvik_ Sweden. Groundwater resources were calculated based on digitized geological data and assumptions regarding stratigraphic layering taken from well archive data and geological maps. These estimates were then compared with future extractions for domestic water supply using a temporally dynamic water balance model. Suitability analyses for subsurface dams were based on calculated topographic wetness index (TWI) values and geological data_ including stratigraphic information. Groundwater balance calculations indicated that many of the most populated areas were susceptible to frequent water supply shortages. Of the 34 sub-catchments within the study area: ten were over-extracted_ nine did not have any water supply demand at all_ one was self-sufficient and the remaining 14 were able to meet the water supply demand with surplus storage capacity. Six suitable sites for the construction of subsurface dams were suggested in the vicinity of the over-extracted sites based on suitability analysis and groundwater balance estimates. The new methodology shows encouraging results for regions with humid climate but having limited natural water storage capacities. The developed methodology can be used as a preliminary planning step for subsurface dam construction_ establishing a base for more detailed field investigations.","Locating suitable sites for the construction of subsurface dams using GIS"

FTLD is a genetically complex neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in the PGRN and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes being the most common known causes of familial FTLD. In this study_ we investigated 39 patients with FTLD_ previously found negative for mutations in PGRN and MAPT_ for copy number alterations of these 2 genes. Methods: Gene dosage analysis of PGRN and MAPT was performed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Results: We did not identify any PGRN or MAPT gene dosage variations in the 39 FTLD patients investigated.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth26520_7","A key issue in system identification is how to cope with high system complexity. In this contribution WE stress the importance of taking the application into account in order to cope with this issue. We define the concept "cost of complexity" which is a measure of the minimum required experimental effort (e.g._ used input energy) as a function of the system complexity_ the noise properties_ and the amount_ and desired quality_ of the system information to be extracted from the data. This measure gives the user a handle on the tradeoffs that must be considered when performing identification with a fixed experimental "budget". Our analysis is based on the observation that the identification objective is to guarantee that the estimated model ends up within a pre-specified "level set" of the application objective. This geometric notion leads to a number of useful insights: Experiments should reveal system properties important for the application but may also conceal irrelevant properties. The latter_ dual_ objective can be explored to simplify model structure selection and model error assessment issues. We also discuss practical issues related to computation and implementation of optimal experiment designs. Finally_ we illustrate some fundamental limitations that arise in identification of structured systems.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth85504_7","Quaternary deposits and topography are two geological parameters which have a great impact on transport and retardation of radionuclides from a leaking repository of high level nuclear waste in crystalline bedrock. Due to the hydraulic and sorption properties of quaternary deposits_ even thin layers significantly increase the residence time of leaking radionuclides. This study also shows that the flow paths predominantly discharge in low areas of the catchments where the layers of quaternary deposits often are relatively deep. The effect of topography is depending on the relationship between the local(kilometres) topography at the repository site and the large scale(hundreds of kilometres) topography surrounding the site area. The areas studied here_ are located at discharge areas of deep groundwater flow_ driven by large scale topography. Therefore residence times of radionuclides significantly decrease when large scale topography is accounted for.

One ordinary class with 12-year-old students was chosen and their regular classroom work was studied without intervention and with a minimum of interference. Lessons were video filmed_ transcribed and analyzed focussing on the participants’ speech acts. It was found that students’ initiatives and experiences were important parts of their participation. The results show how students’ participation was orchestrated with a science content by means of four different kinds of activities. The activities are called ‘individual inventory of experiences’_ ‘building a common platform of experiences’_ ‘sharing new experiences’ and ‘concluding a common platform’. The activities form a foundation for participation in human biology topics. For example_ to ‘build a common platform of experiences’ seems to level out students’ different prerequisites for participating in subsequent tasks. Furthermore_ to ‘conclude a common platform’ implied a checkpoint of the shared new experiences. The activities support students’ tentative use of scientific words as well as their learning of what counts as knowledge in the school science setting. However_ it can be questioned if the time spent on each separate activity is necessary or if similar achievements could be made even if some activities were integrated.

Objective: The aim of the study was to relate the levels of total IgA_ SIgA and allergen-specific IgA antibodies in saliva to the development of allergy in infants during the first 2 years of life. Methods: Saliva samples from 80 infants participating in a prospective study regarding the development of allergy were collected at 3 or 6_ and 12 and 24 months of age. Total IgA_ SIgA and Fel d 1 and ▀-lactoglobulin specific IgA levels were analysed with ELISA. Results: The levels of total IgA and SIgA increased with age. The number of samples with detectable IgA to Fel d 1 tended to increase with age_ whereas the opposite was observed for IgA to ▀-lactoglobulin. Infants who developed allergy tended to have higher levels of total IgA_ and allergen-specific IgA was more commonly detected than in non-allergic children. In contrast_ non-allergic children tended to have higher levels of SIgA. Furthermore_ the levels of SIgA were higher in sensitized infants with no allergic symptoms than in sensitized children with symptoms. Infants with allergic parents had lower SIgA levels than infants without. Direct exposure to cat and cow's milk did not influence the levels of allergen-specific IgA levels_ nor was there any association between breast-feeding and IgA production. Conclusion: The kinetics of food and inhalant allergen-specific IgA in saliva during the first 2 years of life is similar to what has earlier been shown for IgG in serum. Development of allergy tended to be associated with high levels of total and allergen-specific IgA antibodies_ but low levels of SIgA. Furthermore_ high levels of SIgA seemed to protect sensitized children from developing allergic symptoms during the first 2 years of life_ supporting a possible protective role of SIgA against development of allergy.","Total and allergen-specific immunoglobulin a levels in saliva in relation to the development of allergy in infants up to 2 years of age"

A central idea is that actions are not described as having effects that directly alter the world state.

By the use of two photodetectors for detection of the backscattered light_ the influences of mode interference and broadband noise from the laser and noise from surrounding light sources have been suppressed. The instrument is designed to give a continuous_ stable and linear real-time measure of the flux of red cells (i.e. the number of red cells times their velocity) in the outermost layer (1 mm) of tissue_ in which the red cell volume fractions are low or moderate. Linearity_ measuring depth and the influence of blood oxygen tension were evaluated in a flow model with optical properties similar to those of human skin. Laser Dopplerflowmetry was found to be versatile for measurements of blood flow in human skin and rat testis and did not influence the flow under study.An extensive study of spatial and temporal variations of human skin blood flow was performed. As it was found that skin blood flow shows wide day-to-day variations and significant differences between adjacent probe sites_ earlier reported "normal" values of skin blood flow were seriously questioned. It is proposed that this study can serve as a base for further functional studies.Testicular blood flow in rats was studied in order to evaluate acute effects of stress-linked substances such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Both substances lowered the blood flow at high doses.Rhythmical variations of blood flow (frequency 5-12 min-1) in human skin and rat testis were observed and found to be in agreement with earlier findings in microscopic studies on other types of tissue. The nature and origin of this rhythmicity point towards a local regulatory mechanism operating also under "steady state" conditions.","On laser Doppler flowmetry"

"oai_DiVA_org_hh20616_7","The aim of this study was to ascertain the perceptions of parents_ with first time major depression_ regarding the social support for themselves and their children. Eighteen parents_ with children under the age of 19_ were interviewed on admission to an inpatient unit and of these 16 were followed up 1 year later. In addition_ the severity of parents' depression and their functional status was measured. The results showed that although the parents did regain their mental health and functional capacity to a certain extent_ they nevertheless remained in a vulnerable position_ increasing the strain on the whole family. The parents' and their children's social support was low and came mostly from outside the family. The parents were worried about their children_ due to problems related to the depressive episode as well as ordinary teenage rebellion. Important questions concerned practical problems such as whether there was someone to take care of the children if the parent is incapable of doing so. There were also concerns pertaining to how the changed family situation might interfere with the child's natural development or whether depression was a question of heredity. This highlights the need to investigate the importance of social support for the family as a whole when one of them suffers from depression. There is a need for improved treatment of parental depression to reduce symptoms such as decreased functional status that may impair parenting. The study also emphasises the need for healthcare practitioners to assess multiple aspects of social support so that care planning will target all relevant domains.","Parents with first time major depression"
"oai_DiVA_org_hig16040_7","Objective The objective of this study is to compare coping strategies between adults with and without congenital heart disease and to scrutinize the associations between different available resources (e.g._ social support) and adoption of certain coping strategies.DesignThe study has a cross-sectional case-control design.SettingThe study was conducted in two university-affilliated heart hospitals in Tehran_ Iran.Patients The participants comprised 347 persons (18–64 years) with and 353 individuals without congenital heart disease_ matched by gender and age.Outcome Measures Coping strategies_ assessed with the Utrecht Coping List-short form_ were compared between both groups. Block-wise multiple regression analyses were conducted to scrutinize the associations between different independent variables (e.g._ demographic/socioeconomic statuses) and adoption of certain styles of coping (dependent variables) among all participants and separately for each group.Results The styles of coping in the patients were comparable with those of the control group. Multivariate analyses revealed that congenital heart disease per se was not associated with style of coping except for palliative reaction pattern. The active problem-solving coping style was associated with never married marital status_ parenthood_ unemployment_ higher level of anxiety/somatic symptoms_ lower level of depressive symptoms_ and better social support. The avoidance behavior style was associated with having a low income_ whereas the expression of emotion style was associated with higher anxiety symptoms_ experience of financial strain_ and income. None of the adopted coping strategies was related to the heart disease variables.Conclusions The adults with congenital heart disease coped as well as adults without congenital heart disease. Marital status_ parenthood_ annual income_ financial strain_ psychological adjustment_ and perceived social support were important explanatory factors in adopting a certain style of coping among adults with congenital heart disease. However_ longitudinal studies with repeated measures are warranted.","Style of Coping and its Determinants in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease in a Developing Country"

Oavsett om målet är att utveckla en ny produkt eller tjänst_ eller att utforma och implementera en ny organisationslösning_ så krävs kompletterande kunskaper från olika områden. Samtidigt är dessa kunskaper vanligen lokaliserade hos en stor mängd aktörer i och utanför organisationen_ och omöjliga för en enskild aktör att samla och förstå. Kunskapen i organisationen kan därför sägas vara distribuerad till sin natur. Dessa olikartade och distribuerade kunskaper behöver därför integreras och företaget behöver utveckla en förmåga att åstadkomma kunskapsintegration.Därmed blir en viktig fråga för personer i ledande ställning som till exempel företagsledare_ chefer_ eller anställda som arbetar med så kallad kunskapshantering (knowledge management)_ hur man kan leda en verksamhet för att åstadkomma kunskapsintegration i företaget. I avhandlingen undersöks denna fråga genom en fallstudie av en fusion mellan managementkonsulter och IT-konsulter. Resultaten visar att kunskapsintegration är förknippad med ett flertal praktiska och politiska hinder_ och att framgångsrik ledning av kunskapsintegration därför är beroende av att vissa förutsättningar är uppfyllda.

Attention to success factors helps to avoid some costly mistakes_ and speeds up the way change is managed. This paper is focused on how to manage critical success factors (CSF) in organisations involved in standards-based Business-to-Business (B2B)_ with a focus on organisational CSFs. An existing CSF framework in IS planning is applied theoretically to a B2B setting. Activities in a B2B standards implementation model are compared and matched against the framework. Results show that the framework is suitable for planning B2B implementations_ essentially for strategic planning. Based on these results we have developed concrete guidelines to be used in the planning phase by strategic planners. Future work will consist of empirical validation_ further detailing the guidelines in order to develop a practically useful ”tool” for managing CSF in a B2B standards implementation.","Managing Critical Success Factors in a B2B Setting"
"oai_DiVA_org_hkr12800_7","Background  Overweight and obesity are epidemic in Western societies and constitute a major public health problem because of adverse effects on vascular health. Vascular factors may play a role in the development of a rapidly growing disease of late life_ Alzheimer disease (AD). Using body mass index (BMI_ calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters)_ we examined whether overweight is a risk factor for dementia and AD.Methods  The relationship between BMI and dementia risk was investigated in a representative cohort of 392 nondemented Swedish adults who were followed up from age 70 to 88 years_ with the use of neuropsychiatric_ anthropometric_ and other measurements. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses included BMI_ blood pressure_ cardiovascular disease_ cigarette smoking_ socioeconomic status_ and treatment for hypertension.Results:  During the 18-year follow-up (4184.8 risk-years)_ 93 participants were diagnosed as having dementia. Women who developed dementia between ages 79 and 88 years were overweight_ with a higher average BMI at age 70 years (27.7 vs 25.7; P = .007)_ 75 years (27.9 vs 25.0; P&lt;.001)_ and 79 years (26.9 vs 25.1; P = .02) compared with nondemented women. A higher degree of overweight was observed in women who developed AD at 70 years (29.3; P = .009)_ 75 years (29.6; P&lt;.001)_ and 79 years (28.2; P = .003) compared with nondemented women. For every 1.0 increase in BMI at age 70 years_ AD risk increased by 36%. These associations were not found in men.Conclusions  Overweight is epidemic in Western societies. Our data suggest that overweight at high ages is a risk factor for dementia_ particularly AD_ in women. This may have profound implications for dementia prevention.","An 18-year follow-up of overweight and risk of Alzheimer disease"
"oai_DiVA_org_hkr7965_7","<h2>Inledning</h2>I slutet av 2009 beslöt Barn- och Utbildningsförvaltningen i Kristianstad Kommun att tillsammans med Högskolan Kristianstad genomföra ett antal så kallade dialoger med föräldrar till förskolebarn i kommunen. Grunden till samarbetet byggde på kommunens intresse av att ta reda på vilka frågor föräldrar har kring barns hälsa och välbefinnande_ samt att forskare från Högskolan Kristianstads besatt specifika kunskaper inom området. Initiativet grundade sig också i Livsmedelsverkets rekommendationer kring maten och måltiden i förskolan_ vilka bland annat innebär att förskolorna rekommenderas att byta ut standardmjölk mot lättmjölk samt att använda lättmargarin med låg halt av mättat fett. Kommunens beslut att följa rekommendationerna har bidragit till upprördhet_ irritation och oförståelse bland många föräldrar_ vilken också avspeglats i media. Föräldrarnas reaktioner tillsammans med problem med övervikt och fetma hos barn i dagens samhälle_ även i tidig ålder_ var två viktiga anledningar till att beslutet togs att genomföra studien.Föräldradialogerna byggde på att föräldrarna samtalade och diskuterade utifrån frågor och problem som de själva formulerat och därmed fick de möjlighet att ge uttryck för egna funderingar och tankar. Målsättningen var att föräldrarna skulle få framföra sina frågor_ synpunkter och önskemål kring små barns hälsa och välbefinnande både i förskolan och hemma_ men också att intresserade föräldrar skulle få information och kunskap inom området.Dialogerna fokuserade på 3 huvudområden: Maten och måltiden_ sömnen och dygnsrytmen och den fysiska aktiviteten. Dessa områden präglar vardagslivet och kräver rutiner och vanor för att fungera. De utgör en betydande del av förskolan men också hemmet_ och i mötet mellan dessa två arenor blir rutiner_ vanor och beteenden särskilt tydliga.<h2>Syfte</h2>Syftet med samarbetet var således att genomföra ett antal föräldradialoger med föräldrar till förskolebarn i Kristianstad kommun samt att forskare från Högskolan Kristianstad i samband med dessa också skulle hålla föredrag samt besvara föräldrarnas frågor kring de ovan nämnda temana. Det var viktigt att barnens hela livssituation skulle inbegripas_ såväl på som utanför förskolan.<h2>Bakgrund</h2>Mat_ måltider_ sömn_ återhämtning samt fysisk aktivitet är alla viktiga delar av våra levnadsvanor. Gynnsamma levnadsvanor stärker våra livsresurser och hjälper kroppen och hjärnan att komma till sin rätt. Under tillväxtåren har kroppen ökade behov och en ökad sårbarhet. För att fungera optimalt gynnas kroppen av förutsägbara och regelbundna måltider under dagtid. Likaså har sömnen_ dess kvalitet_ tidpunkt och längd stor betydelse för aptit_ immunsystem och hälsa. Kroppen mår bra av en stabil dygnsrytm där vi växlar mellan aktivitet och vila_ ätande och fasta_ vakenhet och sömn. Daglig fysisk aktivitet och utevistelse i dagsljus har en stärkande effekt på kropp och hjärna.Redan som barn socialiseras vi in i vissa vanor och beteende när det gäller maten_ sömnen eller den fysiska aktiviteten. Det är viktigt att barnet tidigt etablerar hälsosamma matvanor och får möjlighet till ett balanserat ätande. Såväl undernäring (för lite energi och/eller näring) som övernäring (för mycket energi_ övervikt och fetma) och felnäring (fetma i kombination med brist på livsnödvändiga näringsämnen) förekommer hos barn_ och här har både förskola_ skola och föräldrar ett ansvar. Utöver maten och måltiden är sömnen nödvändig för psykisk och fysisk överlevnad och välmåga. När vi sover får kroppen möjlighet att växa_ reparera organ och vävnader och att underhålla immunsystemet. Barn behöver mycket sömn_ från 1416 timmar som spädbarn till cirka 9 timmar som tonåring. Sömnstörningar är dessvärre vanligt_ även hos barn_ och forskning har visat sig finns samband mellan sömnbrist och fetma. Vidare rör sig barn generellt för lite_ vilket inte bara är ett problem när de är små_ utan också när de blir äldre. Antalet överviktiga förväntas att öka dramatiskt eftersom unga fysiskt inaktiva riskerar att bli fysiskt inaktiva som vuxna. En fysiskt aktiv livsstil är förenad med minskad risk att utveckla sjukdomstillstånd som hjärt-kärlsjukdomar_ typ 2-diabetes_ fetma_ osteoporos_ cancer_ demens_ depression med mera. Fysisk aktivitet stärker sömnen och gynnar mental prestationsförmåga Fysisk aktivitet har även visat sig ha positiva effekter på den mentala hälsan samt på möjligheten att hantera stress. Studier har också visat på kopplingar mellan fysisk kapacitet och betyg i skolan. Trots den fysiska aktivitetens positiva effekter_ har utrymmet för denna minskat i skolan.Det finns ett antal nationella och internationella policydokument och handlingsplaner med syfte att motverka fetma_ stimulera till bättre matvanor och en ökad fysisk aktivitet. Däremot saknas än så länge rekommendationer för sömnens och dygnsrytmens betydelse trots att forskningen inom området är övertygande. Nordiska Ministerrådet har bland annat utarbetat en nordisk handlingsplan för hälsa_ mat och fysisk aktivitet. I överensstämmelse med EU Kommissionen framhåller Nordiska Ministerrådet att barn och ungdomar ska prioriteras i det hälsofrämjande arbetet_ vilket bland annat innebär att det ska finnas tillgång till hälsofrämjande mat under skoldagen samt att ett ökat intag av frukt och grönt i skolan förordas. Vidare lyfts betydelsen av att fysisk aktivitet integreras i vardagliga inomhus- och utomhusaktiviteter. Betydelsen av att främja goda kostvanor och fysisk aktivitet återfinns också i regeringens proposition för en förnyad folkhälsopolitik samt i Livsmedelsverkets och Folkhälsoinstitutets handlingsplan för goda matvanor och fysisk aktivitet. De nordiska och svenska näringsrekommendationerna (NNR och SNR) bidrar med råd och rekommendationer för en näringsmässigt riktig kost för olika åldersgrupper_ samt innehåller rekommendationer för fysisk aktivitet.<h2>Metod och tillvägagångssätt</h2>Under mars 2010 genomfördes totalt 4 föräldradialoger på olika skolor i Kristianstad Kommun. Inbjudan till dialogerna gick ut till föräldrar till förskolebarn i åldrarna 6 månader till 6 år_ bland annat genom att lappar delades ut där intresse kunde anmälas. Föräldradialogen som metod bygger på aktivt deltagande från medverkande personer och på deras egna frågor_ funderingar och erfarenheter. Totalt medverkade 86 föräldrar under dessa 4 träffar_ varav 70 var kvinnor och 16 män. Föräldradialogerna varade i cirka två och en halv timme per tillfälle. Efter en kortare inledning och introduktion av syfte och tillvägagångssätt delades föräldrarna upp i mindre grupper för diskussion. Medverkande i grupperna var därutöver en moderator (en rektor från skolområdet) som ledde diskussionen_ samt en forskare från högskolan som observatör i varje grupp. Anteckningar gjordes från diskussionerna_ vilka tillsammans med de frågor som föräldrarna själv antecknat på post-it lappar_ utgjorde materialet för analysen och det empiriska underlaget. Resultatet av föräldradialogerna tillsammans med en kunskapsbakgrund kring betydelsen av och rekommendationer kring maten_ sömnen och den fysiska aktiviteten_ utgör merparten av materialet i rapporten.<h2>Resultat</h2>Resultatet av studien visade att föräldrarna hade många frågor och funderingar kring de områden som studien fokuserade på. De flesta frågor handlade om maten och måltiden_ om tidpunkter för ätande och om hälsosam mat för barn. Många gånger var det detaljfrågor_ till exempel funderingar kring fetthalt i specifika livsmedel_ och sällan sattes problematiken i ett övergripande sammanhang där matvanor_ levnadsvanor_ sömn och fysisk aktivitet integrerades. Flera föräldrar gav uttryck för upplevelsen att vi alltmer gått ifrån ”den naturliga maten”. När det erbjuds lättmjölk istället för standardmjölk ses det av många som ett hot mot det naturliga och därmed det upplevt hälsosamma. Att manipulera med barns hälsa känns obekvämt och man vill gärna att barnen ska serveras den mat ”som man brukar göra”. Förändringar av detta slag ses till stor del som ett hot.Frågorna gav också uttryck för en känsla av bristande insikt i vad som serverades på förskolan och vilken mat som barnet egentligen fick i sig. Man undrade vad det är som styr de olika val som kommunen och förskolan gör kring till exempel inköp av mat. Kopplat till uppfattningar om ”den naturliga matens förträfflighet” fanns också funderingar kring beslut bakom var maten ska tillagas. Att maten lagas lokalt_ gärna på plats på förskolan_ och att det används så mycket råvaror som möjligt istället för halv- och helfabrikat_ lyftes fram som eftersträvansvärt.Föräldrarnas frågor präglades också av undringar kring hur de ska göra om barnet inte äter. Det handlade om specifika livsmedel_ men också om måltidstillfällen. Hur man som förälder ska få barnet att äta vissa grönsaker_ att inta frukost under tidig morgon eller att inte ”småäta” var exempel på sådana frågor. Det eftersträvades också tips på mellanmål_ och hur man på bästa sätt skulle kunna fördela dagens måltider över dygnet_ när förskolans och hemmets tider ska anpassas till varandra. Betydelsen av miljön för måltiderna diskuterades också och på vilket sätt en stökig miljö kunde bidra till att barnen inte åt ordentligt.Frågorna om sömnen kretsade till stor del kring hur mycket barn i en viss ålder ska sova_ samt vikten av när sömnen inträder. Betydelsen av en regelbunden dygnsrytm över veckans alla dagar diskuterades också. Föräldrarna efterfrågade dessutom tips på hur man kan hantera sömnproblem och insomningssvårigheter hos barn i olika åldrar.Att barn måste röra sig är sällan en nyhet_ men flera frågor handlade om hur mycket barn i en viss ålder måste röra sig och om barn utifrån detta får tillräckligt med fysisk aktivitet i sin vardag. Funderingar kring mängden utevistelse i förskolan diskuterades också som en viktig del i att främja fysisk aktivitet. Om barnet kan ha för många aktiviteter_ var en annan fundering_ och om risken finns att man som förälder överstimulerar genom att uppmana till för mycket rörelse.Ansvaret för barnens hälsa och välbefinnande fördelas mellan föräldrar_ förskola och kanske mellan familjer som barnen bor växelvis i. Detta ställer krav på ett logistikarbete och en insikt och öppenhet mellan de olika arenor som barn befinner sig på i sin vardag. Här finns utmaningar men också möjligheter när det gäller att förbättra förutsättningarna för barns hälsa.","Förskolebarns hälsa och välbefinnande"

Denna forskning spänner över ett brett spektrum av metoder och teorier_ varav jag har fokuserat på om lärarnas undervisning kan beskrivas som -elevaktiv eller inte_ -mer eller mindre baserad på bokstudier_ -inriktad på konceptuell förståelse eller mer förmågan att räkna specifika uppgifter. Dessa aspekter diskuteras även i relation till de inblandade lärarnas utbildning. För att kunna jämföra de olika klasserna och lärarna har jag använt ett test av konceptuell förståelse (FCI_ se sektion 3.2) samt enkäter till lärare och elever. Ur ett tyvärr skevt urval av klasser och lärare framgår att det finns stora skillnader på hur lärarna ser på undervisningen och vilka undervisningsmetoder de använder_ samt hur styrt de upplever sitt arbete. Korrelationerna mellan elevernas resultat på FCI och på ordinarie prov på motsvarande mekanik är små_ vilket tyder på att reguljära prov mäter konceptuell förståelse i liten utsträckning. Det finns även skillnader i resultaten i form av elevernas konceptuella förståelse mellan skolorna_ i linje med tidigare forskningsresultat att nyare metoder faktiskt ger bättre resultat_ även om denna preliminära studie inte förmår ge underlag för direkta slutsatser. Resultaten tyder även preliminärt på att manliga elever lyckas få en bättre konceptuell förståelse än kvinnliga elever i skolan.","Bilder av fysik"

Many in Sweden believe that is impossible to introduce BRT_ even though the Swedish towns and cities can benefit from the image_ speed and frequency that BRT symbolizes. The archipelago-like urbanization_ urban sprawl and the uncompetitive journey times of public transportation compared with the private car are identified as main obstacles. New questions emerged: Is it possible to transform and adjust the Swedish towns and cities for BRT? What demands BRT? How is transit-oriented development (TOD) applicable in a Swedish context as a policy to integrate cities and BRT?In this licentiate thesis I investigate the interrelationship between bus transportation and neighborhoods_ between BRT and urban form as well as the possibilities to introduce busways and BRT_ to trigger TOD and to transform the Swedish towns and cities for BRT. Much has been written about BRT_ but seldom by architects or urban planners and designers. BRT and TOD are seen though urban form and processes of urbanization within a morphological tradition established by Kevin Lynch. BRT is represented by paths and nodes that disperse distinctive attractiveness pattern of desirability cores that shape neighborhoods as districts. TOD is about synchronizing the everyday urban life with public transportation systems. BRT-TOD is defined as a policy to recognize desirability cores spread by the different infrastructures of BRT and promote development of urban form within their attractiveness pattern at urban and regional scale. BRT-TOD is discussed as a concept of BRT metropolis in context of the urbanization of Swedish towns and cities. TOD is defined morphologically as public transport cities. A public transport city is a city that in its development adapted to specific public transportation systems. TOD is nothing new in Europe or Sweden. To find regularities of the effect of public transportation systems on cities I do a historical overview of the Swedish towns and cities. In the end the position of bus and BRT_ public transport cities and TOD and possibilities of future urban transformation of the smaller and larger Swedish cities towards BRT metropolises are discussed in context of today’s “‘system’ of automobility” and widespread car society and the emerging knowledge society and its postmodern fringes of urbanization.","Bus rapid transit (BRT) and transitoriented development (TOD)"

Fibres from pine or eucalyptus wood and also one-year crops such as coir_ sisal_ etc. are all good candidates. The poor resistance towards water absorption is one of the drawbacks of natural fibres/polypropylene composites. New natural fibres/polypropylene composites were made and the water absorption in them was studied by immersion of the composites in water at three different temperatures_ 23_ 50 and 70 degreesC. The process of absorption of water was found to follow the kinetics and mechanisms described by Fick's theory. In addition_ the diffusivity coefficient was dependent on the temperature as estimated by means of Arrhenius law. A decrease in tensile properties of the composites was demonstrated_ showing a great loss in mechanical properties of the water-saturated samples compared to the dry samples. The morphology change was monitored by scanning electron microscopy studies of the samples before and after exposure to water and the devastating effect of water on the fibre structure was shown.","Comparison of water absorption in natural cellulosic fibres from wood and one-year crops in polypropylene composites and its influence on their mechanical properties"

The goal is to enable the use of monitoring for quality assurance at development time_ while minimizing the need for post-shipping code rewrites as well as changes to the end-host TCB. Standard automaton-based security policies express constraints on allowed API call/return sequences. Proofs are represented as JML-style program annotations. This is adequate in our case as all proofs generated in our framework are recognized in time polynomial in the size of the program. Policy adherence is proved by comparing the transitions of an inlined monitor with those of a trusted "ghost" monitor represented using JML-style annotations. At time of receiving a program with proof annotations_ it is sufficient for the receiver to plug in its own trusted ghost monitor and check the resulting verification conditions_ to verify that inlining has been performed correctly_ of the correct policy. We have proved correctness of the approach at the Java bytecode level and formalized the proof of soundness in Coq.

"oai_DiVA_org_kth44594_7","BACKGROUND: Motion sickness is a common aeromedical problem that may occur in pilots exposed to increased gravitoinertial load in the head-to-foot direction (+Gz). Since motion sickness may affect autonomic nervous functions including cardiovascular control_ it was hypothesized that it might interfere with cardiovascular responses to high +Gz_ thereby decreasing G tolerance.METHODS: G tolerance and cardiovascular responses to increased G load were studied in nine subjects in a centrifuge environment under two conditions. In the motion sickness condition_ the subject was exposed to a motion sickness provocation (MSP) comprising repeated rapid changes in G load in combination with a regimen of head movements. In the control condition the subject was exposed to similar cumulative G-time stress_ but without the MSP. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured. An index of peripheral vascular resistance was achieved by measuring the difference in skin temperature between the forearm and fingertip (deltaT(forearm-fingertip)).RESULTS: MSP decreased gradual-onset rate G tolerance from 5.1 +/- 1.0 G (mean +/- SD) to 4.6 +/- 0.9 G. There was no change in gradual-onset rate G tolerance in the control condition. Rapid-onset rate G tolerance was lower in the motion sickness (2.9 +/- 0.5 G) than in the control (3.4 +/- 0.3 G) condition. MSP reduced MAP by 11 mmHg and deltaT(forearm-fingertip) by 4.2 +/- 4.1 degrees C. In the control condition MAP and deltaT(forearm-fingertip) were unaffected.CONCLUSIONS: Motion sickness may reduce the arterial pressure response to the extent that the capacity of an individual to withstand increased G loads in the head-to-foot direction is significantly diminished.","Motion sickness decreases arterial pressure and therefore acceleration tolerance"

Their difficulties can be of both psychiatric and physiological nature.Individuals with defined difficulties in this UCD study was more effective than other to point out the difficult areas of the design and at the same time give more hints to the designer of how to solve them. The consequence of the results of the study is to start to rethink of how we choose users to participate in the design process. Maybe the design process becomes more effective and at the same time lowers the need of accessibility adaptation after the design when not only choosing representative participants in the process.","ITV services for all people_ a design study"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth84061_7","The fundamental characterization and quantification of the moisture susceptibility of asphaltic mixes is a very important and timely topic for the asphaltic pavements industry_ and has thus far posed a serious challenge for asphalt mix designers. In this research a fundamental computational-experimental test procedure is demonstrated to measure the moisture susceptibility of the mastic-aggregate bond strength and bond energy. The methodology combines displacement controlled direct tension tests with numerical moisture diffusion analyses and is demonstrated for six different mastic-stone combinations which are frequently used in the Dutch open friction courses. From the results it can be seen that the computed adhesive moisture susceptibilities are consistent with the expected field performance. The measured bond moisture susceptibilities are furthermore compared with the thermodynamical work of adhesion. It is shown that_ qualitatively_ the moisture resistance performance ranking is similar_ but that the actual bond energies show three to four orders of magnitude difference. From this it can be concluded that_ even though the surface energy approach can be very useful in enhancing material selection procedures_ it is still important to actually measure the mechanical strength of the selected aggregate-mastic bond with a mechanical test.","Determination of Moisture Susceptibility of Mastic-Stone Bond Strength and Comparison to Thermodynamical Properties"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth8881_7","The aim is to experimentally study the various modes of heat transfer and to investigate the effect of the HiTAC flame characteristics on the heat transfer intensity and uniformity inside a setni-industrial test furnace using various industrial regenerative burners and various flame configurations namely; single-flame_ twin-flame counter. twin-flame parallel and twin-flame stagger. Measurements of local instantaneous and average temperatures_ heat fluxes and gas composition at several locations inside the furnace were carried out. It was observed that the HiTAC flame with highly reduced temperature fluctuations. turbulent intensity and combustion intensity have a larger reaction zone than a conventional flame. This large flame emits more thermal radiation in spite of its uniform and reduced temperature. Furthermore_ the convective heat transfer was found to be uniform and as high as 30% of the total heat transfer to an object surface in the furnace. On the other hand_ the very high reduction of NOx emission is a consequence of the low temperature and temperature fluctuation levels of the HiTAC flames. The above findings are valid to a similar extent in all burners and configurations but to less extent in the twin-flame counter configuration.","Heat transfer characteristics of HiTAC heating furnace using regenerative burners"

"oai_DiVA_org_liu16092_7","A plasma discharge model has been developed for the bulk plasma (also called the extended presheath) in sputtering magnetrons. It can be used both for high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and conventional dc sputtering magnetrons. Demonstration calculations are made for the parameters of the HiPIMS sputtering magnetron at Link "oping University_ and also benchmarked against results in the literature on dc magnetrons. New insight is obtained regarding the structure and time development of the currents_ the electric fields and the potential profiles. The transverse resistivity eta(perpendicular to) has been identified as having fundamental importance both for the potential profiles and for the motion of ionized target material through the bulk plasma. New findings are that in the HiPIMS mode_ as a consequence of a high value of eta(perpendicular to)_ (1) there can be an electric field reversal that in our case extends 0.01-0.04m from the target_ (2) the electric field in the bulk plasma is typically an order of magnitude weaker than in dc magnetrons_ (3) in the region of electric field reversal the azimuthal current is diamagnetic in nature_ i.e. mainly driven by the electron pressure gradient_ and actually somewhat reduced by the electron Hall current which here has a reversed direction and (4) the azimuthal current above the racetrack can_ through resistive friction_ significantly influence the motion of the ionized fraction of the sputtered material and deflect it sideways_ away from the target and towards the walls of the magnetron.","A bulk plasma model for dc and HiPIMS magnetrons"

In the second part_ the Swedish case is briefly described and considered in light of the academic concerns that have been raised by the British debate. The situation in Sweden may be summarized in three points: First_ there are many signs that the infrastructure for qualitative data archiving and re-use is being developed without the active participation of sufficient epresentatives of the qualitative research community; second_ there are many signs that developing the infrastructure takes as a point of departure neo-positivistic or foundational epistemology_ treating qualitative data in the same way as quantitative data_ with all the methodological problems resulting from this; and third there are very few_ if any_ signs that serious academic debate has started in relation to all the issues that have been raised by the corresponding debate in Britain. ","Towards Qualitative Data Preservation and Re-Use"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu19665_7","Background: Despite the use of anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel in coronary heart disease_ some patients continue to suffer from atherothrombosis. This has stimulated development of platelet function assays to monitor treatment effects. However_ it is still not recommended to change treatment based on results from platelet function assays. This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of a static platelet adhesion assay to detect platelet inhibiting effects of ASA and clopidogrel. The adhesion assay measures several aspects of platelet adhesion simultaneously_ which increases the probability of finding conditions sensitive for anti-platelet treatment. Methods: With a randomised cross-over design we evaluated the anti-platelet effects of ASA combined with clopidogrel as well as monotherapy with either drug alone in 29 patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Also_ 29 matched healthy controls were included to evaluate intra-individual variability over time. Platelet function was measured by flow cytometry_ serum thromboxane B-2 (TXB2)-levels and by static platelet adhesion to different protein surfaces. The results were subjected to Principal Component Analysis followed by ANOVA_ t-tests and linear regression analysis. Results: The majority of platelet adhesion measures were reproducible in controls over time denoting that the assay can monitor platelet activity. Adenosine 5-diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet adhesion decreased significantly upon treatment with clopidogrel compared to ASA. Flow cytometric measurements showed the same pattern (r(2) = 0.49). In opposite_ TXB2-levels decreased with ASA compared to clopidogrel. Serum TXB2 and ADP-induced platelet activation could both be regarded as direct measures of the pharmacodynamic effects of ASA and clopidogrel respectively. Indirect pharmacodynamic measures such as adhesion to albumin induced by various soluble activators as well as SFLLRN-induced activation measured by flow cytometry were lower for clopidogrel compared to ASA. Furthermore_ adhesion to collagen was lower for ASA and clopidogrel combined compared with either drug alone. Conclusion: The indirect pharmacodynamic measures of the effects of ASA and clopidogrel might be used together with ADP-induced activation and serum TXB2 for evaluation of anti-platelet treatment. This should be further evaluated in future clinical studies where screening opportunities with the adhesion assay will be optimised towards increased sensitivity to anti-platelet treatment.","Static platelet adhesion_ flow cytometry and serum TXB2 levels for monitoring platelet inhibiting treatment with ASA and clopidogrel in coronary artery disease"

"oai_DiVA_org_liu7370_7","This thesis contributes to the knowledge of how computer-mediated communication and information sharing works in large groups and networks. In more detail_ the research question put forward is: in large sharing networks_ what concerns do end-users have regarding to whom to provide material? A theoretical framework of gift-giving was applied to identify_ label and classify qualitative end-user concerns with provision. The data collection was performed through online ethnographical research methods in two large sharing networks_ one music-oriented and one photo-oriented. The methods included forum message elicitation_ online interviews_ application use and observation. The result of the data collection was a total of 1360 relevant forum messages. A part from this there are also 27 informal interview logs_ field notes and samples of user profiles and sharing policies. The qualitative analysis led up to a model of relationships based on the observation that many users experienced conflicts of interest between various groups of receivers and that these conflicts_ or social dilemmas_ evoked concerns regarding public and non-public provision of material. The groups of potential recipients were often at different relationship levels. The levels ranged from the individual (ego)_ to the small group of close peers (micro)_ to a larger network of acquaintances (meso) to the anonymous larger network (macro). It is argued that an important focal point for analysis of cooperation and conflict is situated in the relations between these levels. Deepened studies and analysis also revealed needs to address dynamic recipient groupings_ the need to control the level of publicness of both digital material and its metadata (tags_ contacts_ comments and links to other networks) and that users often refrained from providing material unless they felt able to control its direction. A central conclusion is that public and non-public gifting need to co-emerge in large sharing networks and that non-public gifting might be an important factor for the support of continued provision of goods in sustainable networks and communities.","Public and Non-Public Gifting on the Internet"

"oai_DiVA_org_liu84702_7","This paper describes details of the spinodal decomposition and coarsening in metastable cubic Ti0.33Al0.67N and Ti0.50Al0.50N coatings during isothermal annealing_ studied by in-situ small angle x-ray scattering_ in combination with phase field simulations. We show that the isostructural decomposition occurs in two stages. During the initial stage_ spinodal decomposition_ of the Ti0.50Al0.50N alloy_ the phase separation proceeds with a constant compositional wavelength of ∼2.8 nm of the AlN- and TiN-rich domains. The time for spinodal decomposition depends on annealing temperature as well as alloy composition. After the spinodal decomposition_ the coherent cubic AlN- and TiN-rich domains coarsen. The coarsening rate is kinetically limited by diffusion_ which allowed us to estimate the diffusivity and activation energy of the metals to 1.4 × 10−6 m2 s−1 and 3.14 eV at−1_ respectively.","Microstructure evolution during the isostructural decomposition of TiAlN"

An analysis method for measuring these inhomogeneities is proposed in this work. The first aim was to develop a quantitative analysis method that could discriminate between Monte Carlo simulated normal and COPD lung SPECT images. A second aim was to evaluate the ability of the present method to discriminate between human subjects with advanced COPD and healthy volunteers.METHODS:In the simulated COPD study_ different activity distributions in the lungs were created to mimic the healthy lung (normal) and different levels of COPD. Gamma camera projections were Monte Carlo simulated_ representing clinically acquired projections of a patient who had inhaled 125 MBq 99mTc-Technegas followed by a 10-min SPECT examination. Reconstructions were made with iterative ordered subset expectation maximisation. The coefficient of variance (CV) was calculated for small overlapping volumes covering the 3D reconstructed activity distribution. A CV threshold value (CVT) was calculated as the modal value of the CV distribution of the simulated normal. The area under the distribution curve (AUC)_ for CV values greater than CVT_ AUC(CVT)_ was then calculated. Moreover_ five patients with advanced emphysema and five healthy volunteers inhaled approximately 75 MBq 99mTc-Technegas immediately before the 20-min SPECT acquisition. In the human study_ CVT was based on the mean CV distribution of the five healthy volunteers.RESULTS:A significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) was found between the Monte-Carlo simulated normal and COPD lung SPECT examinations. The present method identified a total reduction of ventilation of approximately 5%_ not visible to the human eye in the reconstructed image. In humans the same method clearly discriminated between the five healthy volunteers and five patients with advanced COPD (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS:While our results are promising_ the potential of the AUC(CVT) method to detect less advanced COPD in patients needs further clinical studies.","Quantitative lung SPECT applied on simulated early COPD and humans with advanced COPD"

After admission of this application into the framework_ the integrated component still has to satisfy its tasks' deadline constraints and it must execute jobs in the same order as it did previously on the dedicated processor_ regardless of the actual supply of processor resources. We propose a method - called virtual scheduling - which establishes this by reconstructing an appropriate order of delivering events. Virtual scheduling is therefore independent of the component-level scheduling policy and it is transparent to a component_ so that it is even applicable without making modifications to the code or specification of the application.","Virtual scheduling for compositional real-time guarantees"

However_ conserved synteny is an important signal that can help distinguish homology and it has not been utilized to its fullest potential.ResultsHere_ we present GenFamClust_ a pipeline that combines the network properties of sequence similarity and synteny to assess homology relationship and merge known homologs into groups of gene families. GenFamClust identifies homologs in a more informed and accurate manner as compared to similarity based approaches. We tested our method against the Neighborhood Correlation method on two diverse datasets consisting of fully sequenced genomes of eukaryotes and synthetic data.ConclusionsThe results obtained from both datasets confirm that synteny helps determine homology and GenFamClust improves on Neighborhood Correlation method.

After cervical spinal cord injury in adult rats_ a graft consisting of PHB fibers coated with alginate hydrogel + fibronectin was implanted in the lesion cavity. In control groups_ PHB was omitted and only alginate hydrogel or fibronectin_ or their combination_ were used for grafting. In addition_ comparisons were made with animals treated intrathecally after spinal cord injury with the neurotrophic factors BDNF or NT-3. The neurons of the rubrospinal tract served as experimental model. In untreated animals_ 45% of the injured rubrospinal neurons were lost at 8 weeks postoperatively. Implantation of the PHB graft reduced this cell loss by 50%_ a rescuing effect similar to that obtained after treatment with BDNF or NT-3. In the absence of PHB support_ implants of only alginate hydrogel or fibronectin_ or their combination_ had no effect on neuronal survival. After addition of neonatal Schwann cells to the PHB graft_ regenerating axons were seen to enter the graft from both ends and to extend along its entire length.

Actuarial analysis adjusted for patients' death was used for calculating the cumulative incidence of reoperation. Relative risk for reoperation was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: From 1996 to 1998_ 17_985 groin hernia operations were recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register_ 15% for recurrent hernia and 85% for primary hernia. At 24 months the risk for having had a reoperation was 4.6% after recurrent hernia repair and 1.7% after primary hernia repair. The relative risk for reoperation was significantly lower for laparoscopic methods and for anterior tension-free repair than for other techniques. Postoperative complications and direct hernia were associated with an increased relative risk for reoperation. Day-case surgery and local infiltration anesthesia were used less frequently for recurrent hernia than for primary hernia.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent groin hernia still constitutes a significant quantitative problem for the surgical community.

Men vilken kompetens och utbildning har de som undervisar i ämnet? Med utgångspunkter i Bourdieus kultursociologiska teorier krävs det ett specifikt innehav av kapital för att få tillträde till ett område eller befattning. Inom skolans värld skulle man kunna förvänta sig att det kapital som krävs för att kunna verka som lärare framförallt utgörs av en lärarexamen med relevanta ämneskunskaper. I SFS (2011:326) och SFS (1993:100) specificeras de formella kraven för en lärarexamen som i sin tur krävs för att vara behörig att undervisa i gymnasieskolan. Det finns däremot ämnen som det inte finns någon lärarutbildning i_ ex. specialidrott. Detta paper behandlar vilka former av kapital det är som blir värdefulla när inte de formella kraven går att uppnå.Syftet med detta paper är att belysa vilken bakgrund och vilka tillgångar de som undervisar i specialidrott innehar. Teoretiskt stödjer sig analysen främst på Bourdiues begrepp kapital.Det empiriska underlaget består av enkätsvar från 109 individer som undervisar i specialidrott vid tio strategiskt utvalda idrottsutbildningar_ fem riksidrottsgymnasier och fem gymnasieskolor. Materialet samlades in genom den nationella utvärderingen av specialidrott 2008/09.En majoritet av de som undervisar i specialidrott utgörs av män och få har en utländsk bakgrund. Ungefär 70% av de som undervisar har någon form av universitets- eller högskoleutbildning_ varav 45% har lärarutbildning (28% i idrott och hälsa). I jämförelse har 95% någon form av tränarutbildning_ främst från idrottens egna utbildningssystem_ men också från olika högskolor. Lärarnas självuppskattade kompetens är hög_ främst inom de specifika idrotterna_ men även inom olika teoretiska idrottskunskaper. Lägre kompetens upplever sig lärarna ha inom betygsättning och bedömning. Möjligen unikt för gruppen är att endast ungefär hälften av lärarna har den specifika skolan som arbetsgivare_ resterande är anställda av en idrottsorganisation.Det har under en period inte funnits någon reguljär lärarutbildning inom ämnet specialidrott i Sverige_ detta visar sig genom resultatet att endast en minoritet av ”lärarna” i studien innehar en lärarexamen. Istället verkar det värdefullaste kapitalet bestå av tränarutbildningar och ett tydligt habitus med smak för specifika idrotter. Att det inom ämnet specialidrott är andra former av kapital som är värdefulla jämfört med traditionella ämnen_ kan få effekter för ämnets status i skolan och påverka undervisningens likvärdighet. Genom den senaste gymnasiereformen har kravet på lärarlegitimation införts för att man ska kunna vara verksam som lärare inom skolan. Specialidrott är däremot tillsvidare undantaget detta krav då ämnet är kategoriserat som ett yrkesämne_ men detta kan komma att förändras beroende av utfallet av skolverkets konsekvensutredning.","Lärare eller tränare?

Furthermore_ HA is present in pig oviduct fluid and the lining epithelium_ particularly of the pre-ovulatory sperm reservoir. Because the mechanisms that regulate HA synthesis have not yet been clarified_ semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to assess the expression of mRNAs of two HA-synthesizing enzymes (has2 and has3) in the oviduct epithelium (uterotubal junction_ isthmus_ ampullary-isthmic junction and ampulla segments) of non-inseminated (control) and inseminated (treatment) sows at pre-_ peri- and post-ovulatory oestrus.

The level of has3 expression did not vary significantly between non-inseminated and inseminated specimens_ but there was a tendency (NS) for increased mean values during the peri- and post-ovulatory stages compared with pre-ovulation.

TheIgG levels in developing oozytes (6 - 37 mm) were similar_ and there was a significant linearcorrelation between antibody response in serum and corresponding egg yolk.

Given a set of surveillance UGVs and a user defined area to be covered_ find waypoint-paths such that; 1) the area is completely surveyed_ 2) the time for performing the search is minimized and 3) the induced information graph is kept recurrently connected. It has previously been shown that the CUSP is NP-hard. This paper presents four different heuristic algorithms for solving the CUSP_ namely_ the Token Station Algorithm_ the Stacking Algorithm_ the Visibility Graph Algorithm and the Connectivity Primitive Algorithm. These algorithms are then compared by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The conclusions drawn are that the Token Station Algorithm provides the most optimal solutions_ the Stacking Algorithm has the lowest computational complexity_ while the Connectivity Primitive Algorithm provides the best trade-off between optimality and computational complexity for larger problem instances.","Algorithms for the connectivity constrained unmanned ground vehicle surveillance problem"
"oai_DiVA_org_hh16211_7","The implementation of ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) services offers great potential to improve the level of safety_ efficiency and comfort on our roads. Although cooperative traffic safety applications rely heavily on the support for real-time communication_ the Medium Access Control (MAC) mechanism proposed for the upcoming IEEE 802.11p standard_ intended for ITS applications_ does not offer deterministic real-time support_ that is_ the access delay to the common radio channel is not upper bounded. To address this problem_ we present a framework for a vehicle-to-infrastructure-based (V2I) communication solution extending IEEE 802.11p by introducing a collision-free MAC phase assigning each vehicle an individual priority based on its geographical position_ its proximity to potential hazards and the overall road traffic density. Our solution is able to guarantee the timely treatment of safety-critical data_ while minimizing the required length of this real-time MAC phase and freeing bandwidth for best-effort services (targeting improved driving comfort and traffic efficiency). Furthermore_ we target fast connection setup_ associating a passing vehicle to an RSU (Road Side Unit)_ and proactive handover between widely spaced RSUs. Our real-time MAC concept is evaluated analytically and by simulation based on a realistic task set from a V2I highway merge assistance scenario.","Real-time communication support for cooperative_ infrastructure-based traffic safety applications"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth111522_7","In this paper_ we study two hierarchical N-Body methods for Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures. The modern Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) designs are mainly based on the shared-bus communication architecture. As the number of cores increases_ it suffers from high communication delays. Therefore_ NoC based architecture is proposed. The N-Body problem is a classical problem of approximating the motion of bodies. Two methods_ namely Barnes-Hut (Barnes) and Fast Multipole (FMM)_ have been developed for fast simulation. The two algorithms have been implemented and studied in conventional computer systems and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However_ as a promising unconventional multicore architecture_ the evaluation of N-Body methods in a NoC platform has not been well addressed. We define a NoC model based on state-of-the-art systems. Evaluation results are presented using a cycle accurate full system simulator. Experiments show that_ Barnes scales better (53.7x/Barnes and 36.6x/FMM for 64 processing elements) and requires less cache than FMM. However_ we observe hot-spot traffic in Barnes.

"oai_DiVA_org_hig2720_7","The international market of services is growing at a faster rate. Despite the importance of the service sector in both domestic and world markets_ the amount of empirical research addressing the internationalization of services remains relatively low. Nature and characteristic of services have made service marketing and study related to it difficult. If the service is set for international market_ question around intangibility_ quality_ and the demand for simultaneous production and consumption is likely to aggravate the situation. As people across the borders are different from a cultural viewpoint_ the same service element can be perceived differently making the service internationalization process further difficult. This paper deals with a case of Swedish medical service marketing process in Egypt and offers a profound insight on the complex issue of international services marketing by addressing the following research questions:The data collection was a rigorous process and mainly took place in the form of direct interviews. Eight people including the managing director and the major owner of the Swedish-Egyptian firm were interviewed. Further three local consultants were interviewed and two seminars were held in Egypt to have an idea on general business practice in the host country. The conceptual framework is based on three variables_ i.e. cultural adaptation_ trust and network. Selling service internationally requires that the service provider is aware of the local taste_ preference and habit. To be successful in internationalization_ it is usually necessary that some cultural adaptation takes place_ probably from both sides. The intangible characteristic of the services requires that trust is built and maintained throughout if the internationalization process has to be successful. Network represents a critical point of investigation in understanding internationalization. Network development is very important where the uncertainty is high due to physical and cultural distance_ communication gap and service characteristics themselves which make the offerings heterogeneous_ perishable and difficult to readily display. This study shows that cultural adaptation has taken place in respect to timing_ building trust in the local environment_ handling bureaucratic issues_ local traditions and offering services to the clients. Problem of intangibility_ heterogeneity and quality has been solved by providing consistent services and establishing links with the medical colleges and other institutions. This research work offers several opportunities for learning. First_ it is important to recognize cultural differences and local traditions to design the service concept. Second_ there is a need to develop sufficient local contacts and trust to make the service offerings tangible. Finally_ the adaptation needs to take place from both sides_ otherwise promising factors and strength may be kept outside the final business concept offered to the clients.","International services marketing"
"oai_DiVA_org_hig2765_7","The industrial revolution significantly changed the way work was organized and analyzed by the introduction and widespread implementation of the division of labor philosophy. This philosophy has continued to dominate work design_ and has evolved beyond the factory to include many facets of service industries_ and even professional occupations. The analysis of manual work_ particularly materials handling tasks_ remains an active domain of ergonomics research and practice. Many of the task-analytic tools used for workplace analysis are rooted in the philosophy of dividing work into elements_ analyzing the individual elements_ and synthesizing the results into conclusions about the entire job_ including the risk of contracting musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The authors discuss the notion that the nature of modern work_ which is characterized by multiple tasks in a complex time pattern_ and the complex nature of MSDs_ which are influenced by biomechanical as well as psychological_ political_ and economic factors_ may limit the effectiveness of classical task analytic techniques in preventing MSDs.","On the evolution of task-based analysis of manual materials handling_ and its applicability in contemporary ergonomics"

Complex path-following procedures are used to find generalized equilibrium paths_ with different parameterizations.

In this model_ the soil ionization region is assumed to retain 7% of its pre-ionization resistivity_ which is consistent with the experimental results on soil ionization found in literature (Trans. SA Inst. Electr. Eng. (1988) 63; AIEE Trans. 61 (1942) 349; Proc. IEE 121(2) (1974) 123) and our own laboratory experiments (Time domain modelling of the response of grounding systems subjected to lightning currents_ Licenciate Thesis_ Uppsala University_ 2003). Compared with modelling the soil ionization as an increase in the size of the ground conductor_ the model presented here will not overestimate the beneficial influence of the soil ionization in reducing the ground potential rise_ especially in high resistivity soil. The model is also applied to study the transient behaviour of grounding conductors in stratified soil under lightning strike including soil ionization. It shows that making the grounding conductor to penetrate the lower resistivity soil layer could help to decrease the ground potential rise at the injection point several times.","An improved model for soil ionization around grounding system and its application to stratified soil"
"oai_DiVA_org_kth39533_7","In the second half of the 194os_ women made up more than 50 per cent of all immigrants to Sweden_ a proportion that had fallen slightly to just under so per cent by 1960. Given that these women_ despite their numerical strength_ seem to be invisible in Swedish immigration history_ there is thus every reason to analyse immigration to Sweden in 1945-1960 more closely. The purpose of the present study is to analyse the immigration of women to Sweden from Finland_ Norway_ and West Germany in the years immediately following the Second World War. The study found that the reasons why people chose to immigrate to Sweden in this period went beyond the factors usually mentioned: labour demand and high_ and rising_ real wages in Sweden (the pull factors)_ and high levels of unemployment in their home countries (the push factor). Swedish-speaking Finns' sense of insecurity in post-war Finland_ Finland's reparations_ and the fear of being Sovietized in all probability influenced people's willingness to emigrate. This was true not only of the men_ but also the women. It can be inferred that many of the Norwegian women who moved to Sweden up to the early 1950s were tysketoser_"German girls". In bomb-wrecked Germany_ full-scale food rationing was in place until the end of the 1940s_ and there were shortages of almost everything. Thanks to the good offices of Sweden's National Labour Market Board_ 10_000 German refugee women were ferried across to join the Swedish labour market as domestic servants.","Invandringen av kvinnor till Sverige från Finland_ Norge och Västtyskland 1945–1960"

"oai_DiVA_org_kth92047_7","The Advanced GAmma Tracking Array (AGATA) is a European project to develop and operate the next generation gamma-ray spectrometer. AGATA is based on the technique of gamma-ray energy tracking in electrically segmented high-purity germanium crystals. This technique requires the accurate determination of the energy_ time and position of every interaction as a gamma ray deposits its energy within the detector volume. Reconstruction of the full interaction path results in a detector with very high efficiency and excellent spectral response. The realisation of gamma-ray tracking and AGATA is a result of many technical advances. These include the development of encapsulated highly segmented germanium detectors assembled in a triple cluster detector cryostat_ an electronics system with fast digital sampling and a data acquisition system to process the data at a high rate. The full characterisation of the crystals was measured and compared with detector-response simulations. This enabled pulse-shape analysis algorithms_ to extract energy_ time and position_ to be employed. In addition_ tracking algorithms for event reconstruction were developed. The first phase of AGATA is now complete and operational in its first physics campaign. In the future AGATA will be moved between laboratories in Europe and operated in a series of campaigns to take advantage of the different beams and facilities available to maximise its science output. The paper reviews all the achievements made in the AGATA project including all the necessary infrastructure to operate and support the spectrometer.","AGATA-Advanced GAmma Tracking Array"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu25794_7","Neutrophil granulocytes are known to rapidly adhere and undergo frustrated phagocytosis upon contact with immunoglobulin and/or complement protein opsonized artificial surfaces. In this study_ we examined the relation between serum protein deposition and human neutrophil activation on hydrophobic glass and silicon model surfaces that were coated with immunoglobulin G or M (IgG/IgM)_ both initiators of the classical complement pathway. Protein adsorption from normal human serum (NHS) was quantified with null-ellipsometry combined with antibody techniques. The neutrophil oxygen radical production was registered by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (CL) and the morphology_ as well as changes in the content of filamentous actin (F-actin)_ were documented by fluorescence microscopy. Complement factor 3 (C3) bound to both IgG- and IgM-coated surfaces_ but surprisingly C1q was found only on IgG-coated surfaces. Both immunoglobulins triggered complement dependent neutrophil activation. However_ CL and F-actin accumulation were found sensitive to the presence of C1q in the serum only at the IgG-coated surface. We suggest that spontaneously adsorbed IgM activates the complement system and interacts with neutrophils by C1q-independent mechanisms.","C1q-independent activation of neutrophils by immunoglobulin M-coated surfaces"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu28037_7","This study_ comprising 7 separate papers_ is concerned with the mechanical causes of graft failure after intraarticular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The study is predominantly experimental in design_ but a clinical follow-up is also included to test a causal hypothesis of secondary graft elongation.Fixations of synthetic ACL substitutes with ligament staples had low security and the maximum tolerance loads were in parity with forces generated during daily activities_ while screw fixations of looped ligaments had higher load to failure than a normal ACL.A stenosis_ caused by osteophyte formation_ was found at the intercondylar notch less than 2 years after an ACL tear_ strongly suggesting impingement and wear as a possible mechanism of ACL substitute failure. The intercondylar notch was also found to be narrowed in patients with an acute tear of the ACL compared to a normal control group_ thus implying causality.A standardized technique of graft placement_ using a guide to aid bone drilling_ was found more accurate and reproducible in achieving desired graft insertions compared to freehand drilling. This was evaluated by a new method for detennining the graft insertion locations on the femur and tibia_ using a ratio related to the sagittal depth of the condyles.The ability to restore knee kinematics from an ACL deficient state_ was evaluated for a drill guided graft route and an over-the-top route. The only effect of both methods_ using a dacron graft tensioned in full extension_ was restoring or partially restoring the increased anterior -posterior translation.A good in vitro and in vivo correlation was found between the patterns of change in dynamic fixation distance_ as measured intraoperatively with an isometer_ and tension in the fixed ACL substitute. The isometry measurement could not predict the magnitude of the frnal tension due to the biological variability in soft tissue compliance.Sagittal knee stability was measured at regular intervals for 2 years on patients who had an intraarticular ACL reconstruction with a patellar tendon substitute. Increasing anterior-posterior displacement was found for all patients as a group_ and more for patients with an anterior femoralligament insertion location.A standardized treatment including aided bone drilling_ notch plasty_ isometry measurement_ and restricted postoperative rehabilitation is recommended.","Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu28516_7","This study focuses on subteaching_ a phenomenon that regularly appears in pupil-run group work. On some occasions_ junior high school pupils positioned themselves as subteachers_ and exploited a series of teacher-like strategies. Thus_ by instructing_ evaluating_ and disciplining their peers_ they were found to take on repertoires and practices prototypical of classroom teaching. Thereby_ discursive practices that characterise traditional classroom interaction were reproduced in small-group formats. On other occasions_ subteaching was partly created by the pupils themselves in that they positioned themselves as pupils in relation to co-participant pupils_ who were treated as 'teachers'. Yet_ the same pupils_ at times_ challenged such teacher positionings in a number of ways_ e.g. by resisting the subteacher's task requirements. Regardless of whether pupils were positioned as subteachers or positioned themselves_ subteaching was ultimately always a collaborative affair.","Doing subteaching in school group work"

Capillary microscopy has been used extensively_ both in clinical practice and research_ to study different phenomena in the microvasculature of the skin_ mainly in the nailfold of fingers and toes where a large portion of the capillary loop can be observed.In the majority of the different skin regions_ the nutritive capillary network approaches the skin surface perpendicularly and capillary microscopy in these sites reveals the apex of the capillary loop as a dark spot. The main approach in this work has been to study a large ensemble of capillary loops_ in order to apply statistical and planar models whilst_ at the same time_ obtaining spatial parameters related to the capillary localization.The statistical models of proximity are based on nearest neighbour methods and triangulation techniques. The main reason for introducing these models is because of their capability to characterize the heterogeneity of the capillary ensemble.A computer assisted video microscopy system_ that enables both capturing and evaluating of capillary bed images_ was assembled and was_ thereafter_ successfully used in laboratory and clinical studies.","Computer assisted video microscopy"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu49892_7","Trace amounts of surfactants have an acute influence on measured surface tension of melts and may influence viscosity. A water atomisation experiment was performed to investigate if variations of these elements could affect quality. Effects of water pressure_ melt superheat_ and sulphur content_ iron scrap oxygen content_ and aluminium content were studied. Responses studied were particle size distribution_ apparent density_ flow_ powder chemistry_ morphology_ green density_ and dimensional change. A large sulphur addition reduced the particle size_ as a result of a reduction of surface tension_ but the largest effect came from changing water pressure. Higher water pressures also resulted in powders with lower apparent density_ lower flowrate_ and reduced swelling during sintering. An empirical water atomisation model is proposed. Aluminium additions reduced the powder size standard deviation and increased the carbon content of the powder. A reduced powder size standard deviation was seen also for melts with raised superheating.

"oai_DiVA_org_liu50409_7","In this paper_ a model for prediction of radar backscatter from coniferous forests in the VHF and UHF band is proposed. The model includes the double-bounce scattering originating from vertical stems standing on an undulating ground surface and is based on a physical-optics approach. The model can be used to assess the importance of ground topography in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of forests_ and it is applicable to SAR systems using horizontally transmit and receive polarization (HH). The model was validated against data from the airborne SAR systems CARABAS-II and LORA. Precision measurements of ground topography and forest characterization at a single tree level were used as model input to simulate SAR images. The simulated images were compared to radar data in the frequency bands 22-82 and 225-470 MHz_ and it was found that the model could predict much of the variation in backscatter observed in images (R2 = 0.44 and 0.65 at best_ for the lower and higher frequency band_ respectively)_ which should be compared to R2 ˜ 0.1 if the same model_ but assuming a flat ground_ was used. The results thus indicate that ground topography must be considered when predicting the variations in backscatter in the SAR images studied. The model did_ however_ fail to predict the absolute values of the backscattered intensity. The reason for the discrepancy is believed to be the value chosen for stem dielectric constant and unmodeled effects due to wave attenuation_ tilting stems_ and small-scale surface roughness. © 2008 IEEE.","A physical-optics model for double-bounce scattering from tree stems standing on an undulating ground surface"
"oai_DiVA_org_liu52535_7","In this paper_ the monotonic regression problem (MR) is considered. We have recentlygeneralized for MR the well-known Pool-Adjacent-Voilators algorithm(PAV) from the case of completely to partially ordered data sets. Thenew algorithm_ called GPAV_ combines both high accuracy and lowcomputational complexity which grows quadratically with the problemsize. The actual growth observed in practice is typically far lowerthan quadratic. The fitted values of the exact MR solution composeblocks of equal values. Its GPAV approximation has also a blockstructure. We present here a technique for refining blocks produced bythe GPAV algorithm to make the new blocks more close to those in theexact solution. This substantially improves the accuracy of the GPAVsolution and does not deteriorate its computational complexity. Thecomputational time for the new technique is approximately triple thetime of running the GPAV algorithm. Its efficiency is demonstrated byresults of our numerical experiments.","Generalized PAV algorithm with block refinement for partially ordered monotonic regression"
