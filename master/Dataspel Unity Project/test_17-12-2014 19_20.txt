A test using four co-occurring annual Papaver"  - Solution = "Recognition of Prior Vocational Learning in Sweden" - Abstract: "Initiatives in the recognition of prior learning (RPL) have been taken in Sweden in recent years, mainly focusing on prior vocational learning among immigrants. The government started different projects to find methods for recognising a person’s prior learning in the field of vocational competence. This article presents a study of how these projects were organised and their starting points. Differences are identified concerning whether they were integrated with, or parallel to, the school system, and whether the starting point was a few vocations or a number of different vocations (depending on the background of the participants). The article then looks at some problems that arise when trying to recognise prior learning. We find that knowledge of the Swedish language is essential in this process, but that the demands are flexible and the criteria informal. The article also discusses the relationship between RPL and the educational system, where most of the projects had problems in not being too influenced by the school tradition where the main documentation of competence is grades. Finally, the article discusses conditions for the development of trust in RPL." | GameTime: 22.6207 sec |

In order to improve the material quality, substrates with different off-angles were used, since low off-angle substrates result in a reduction of killer defects for specific devices. Different growth mechanisms dominate for different substrate off-cut and an accurate set up of dedicated surface preparation procedures and tuning of growth parameters are needed. This study demonstrates that silicon-rich gas inputs are favorable for lower off-angle (nominally on-axis) substrates, while carbon-rich are beneficial for higher off-angles (usually 8 degrees off-axis for 4H-SiC). Methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) is shown to be the best precursor to achieve the presented results." | GameTime: 34.82128 sec |

Social conditions, athletes’ experiences, and sustainability consequences" 3= "Quantitative Laser Doppler Flowmetry"  - Solution = "An interdisciplinary perspective on industrial energy efficiency" - Abstract: "This paper combines engineering and social science approaches to enhance our understanding of industrial energy efficiency and broaden our perspective on policy making in Europe. Sustainable development demands new strategies, solutions, and policy-making approaches. Numerous studies of energy efficiency potential state that cost-effective energy efficiency technologies in industry are not always implemented for various reasons, such as lack of information, procedural impediments, and routines not favoring energy efficiency. Another reason for the efficiency gap is the existence of particular values, unsupportive of energy efficiency, in the dominant networks of a branch of trade. Analysis indicates that different sectors of rather closed communities have established their own tacit knowledge, perceived truths, and routines concerning energy efficiency measures. Actors in different industrial sectors highlight different barriers to energy efficiency and why cost-effective energy efficiency measures are not being implemented. The identified barriers can be problematized in relation to the social context to understand their existence and how to resolve them." | GameTime: 49.31227 sec |
