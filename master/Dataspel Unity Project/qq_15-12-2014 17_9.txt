The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between discography-induced pain and morphological disc changes, occurring during axial loaded MRI (alMRI). A secondary aim was to compare and register the frequency of provoked concordant pain at alMRI and discography." | GameTime: 25.50768 sec |
