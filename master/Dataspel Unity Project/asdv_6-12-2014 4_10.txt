These changes were evaluated concerning results, the change process and consequences on organizational performance. A questionnaire to the meat cutters and interviews with the production leaders were conducted. The results support that the meat cutters experienced the changes positively and that a reduction in physical and mental fatigue was reached. Other experiences were mixed indicating that both work organizational characteristics and local history should be taken more into consideration. The organizational performance was not particularly affected." | GameTime: 5.67066 sec |
