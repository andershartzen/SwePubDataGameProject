| New Puzzle Opened - Titles: 0= "Phenomeno-semantic complexity"  - Solution = "Phenomeno-semantic complexity" - Abstract: "This paper proposes a novel notion of complexity, derived from the process of semantic and syntactical transformation of message as communicated between sense-making actors. it distinguishes between complexity driven by syntactical transformation and that driven by semantic transformation. This last is also divided into first- and second-order transformation, the former relating to the observing system and the latter to the observed system of an inquiry. The proposed notion of complexity is juxtaposed with the mainstream notion of complex systems, typically understood as the interaction of adaptive agents governed by local rules, yet giving rise to novel unpredictable global behavior. The proposed notion of phenomenological semantic complexity is illustrated with some examples taken from real-life human affairs. The proposed and conventional notions of complexity are regarded as complementary, yet they require different research strategies; some suggestions for further research are therefore put forward here" | GameTime: 17.89889 sec |
