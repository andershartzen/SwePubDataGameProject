The system comprises a control framework for hybrid force/position control in simulation and reality, a grasp simulator, and an under-actuated robot hand equipped with tactile sensors. We start by presenting the robot hand, the simulation environment and the control framework that enable dynamic simulation of an under-actuated robot hand. We continue by presenting simulation results and also discuss and exemplify the use of simulation in relation to autonomous grasping. Finally, we use the very same controller in real world grasping experiments to validate the simulations and to exemplify system capabilities and limitations." | GameTime: 17.91253 sec |

Particular focus is given to the relationship between the operating picture and situational awareness. The study was conducted using qualitative interviews and a grounded theory approach, and is based on interview data from three crisis events. The results show that the operating picture is influenced by information coming together from different sources and forming a snapshot of the event, a portrait which changes and is updated over time, while organisational belonging, role and occupationally specific knowledge provide a framework for and influence situational awareness. The results also show that the operating picture forms the basis for an occupationally specific and role-based situational awareness and its subsequent decision-making. Further studies on the relation between common operating picture, sense making and situational awareness are discussed. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd." | GameTime: 40.80292 sec |

Legislation, ordinances and quality assurance systems provide guidelines for implementing sustainable production technologies in horticulture at a higher level. Horticultural research has compiled solutions to improve sustainable production. Despite of regulations, hands-on information, solid scientific data on sustainable strategies for horticulture and a general environmental awareness, there is reluctance in considering sustainable technology and reorganizing horticultural production lines. Knowledge within commercial horticulture is situated knowledge; this means experience consolidated within the branch is a precondition for application. However, knowledge on sustainable technology follows the tradition of natural sciences and technology. Another crucial aspect concerns the path from understanding sustainable technology to putting it into action. Reflection on reflection in action as an activity aims at producing a good verbal description of reflection in action, which can be shared with other people. While reflection in or on action is primarily private the notion of reflection on reflection in action is tied to the fact that learning and experience exchange are social activities that proceed in different communities of practice. Dialogue-inspired methods may act as a tool. In the present paper we discuss the dialogue seminar and Socratic dialog methods to bridge the gap between scientific and technological progress in horticulture and horticultural practice to be employed in horticultural extension." | GameTime: 75.69366 sec |

| New Puzzle Opened - Titles: 0= "Industrial symbiosis for improving the CO2-performance of cement" 1= "Oxidation and Corrosion of New MCrAlX Coatings" 2= "A framework for guiding policy makers intervening in emerging innovation systems in 'catching up' countries" 3= "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet"  - Solution = "Industrial symbiosis for improving the CO2-performance of cement" - Abstract: "Justification of the paper Cement production is one of the largest contributors to global CO2-emissions. However, the context and characteristics of the production and the cement products vary a lot. A significant part of the production must be characterized as rather linear, for example, to a large extent based on fossil fuels and involving material flows that are not closed. But there are also much more synergistic examples, involving industrial by-products, renewable energy, etc. Clearly, there are opportunities for improvement within the cement industry and it is interesting to analyze to what extent increased industrial symbiosis can lead to improved climate performance. This has been done by studying the production of cement clinker and three selected cement products produced within the Cluster West in Germany, consisting of three cement plants that are owned by the multinational company CEMEX. The methodology is mostly based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), from cradle-to-gate.PurposeThe overall purpose is to contribute to a better understanding of the climate performance of different ways of producing cement, and different cement products. The climate impact is assessed for “traditional”, rather linear, ways of making cement, but also two more synergistic alternatives, where the by-product granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) is utilized to a large extent, substituting cement clinker. It is also shown how the climate performance of the West Cluster has changed from 1997 until 2009 (the main year of study), and investigated how further industrial symbiosis measures could improve the performance.Theoretical frameworkTo a large extent this project has been based on mapping and analysis of relevant flows of material and energy, where LCA methodology has played an important part. Theoretical and methodological aspects related to the fields of Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis have played an important role. The findings are discussed in relation to some of the key ideas within these fields. The paper generates insight into the methodological challenge of quantifying environmental performance of different production approaches and basically what CO2 improvement potential cement industry has by taking industrial symbiosis measures.ResultsThe results showed that the cement clinker produced at Cluster West is competitive from a climate perspective, causing CO2-eq missions that are a couple of percent lower than the world average. During the twelve year period from 1997 to 2009 these emissions became about 12 percent lower, which was mainly achieved by production efficiency measures but also via changing fuels. However, the most interesting results concern the blended cement products. It was manifested that it is very advantageous from a climate perspective to substitute clinker with granulated blast furnace slag. For example, the CO2-eq emissions were estimated to be 65 percent lower for the best product compared to “ordinary cement”.ConclusionsInformation and measures at the plant level are not sufficient to compare products or to significantly reduce the climate impact related to cement. To achieve important reductions of the emissions, measures and knowledge at a higher industrial symbiosis level are needed." | GameTime: 102.2875 sec |

| New Puzzle Opened - Titles: 0= "Paradoxes of assessing prior learning" 1= "SVELTE: Real-time Intrusion Detection in the Internet of Things" 2= "Indices for detecting differences in species composition" 3= "Socio-technical regimes and heterogeneous capabilities"  - Solution = "Paradoxes of assessing prior learning" - Abstract: "This paper discusses nine paradoxes of assessing prior learning. The assessment, validation, accreditation or recognition (different concepts are used in different contexts) of prior learning or -real competence- has become a focus area in adult education/learning practice as well as policy, in Sweden and in other countries. But, there are paradoxes in the idea and practice of assessing prior learning. The paper is based on theories, on prior research about assessment of prior learning, and on results from more recent empirical research. For example the focus of the assessment is said to be prior learning, but still a main issue in practice is the new learning that seems to be a more or less inevitable result of assessing prior learning. Another paradox is that assessing prior informal/non-formal learning means that the learning backgrounds of individuals are divergent experiences - but the assessment is often made in a convergent way based on common criteria, to make comparisons between individuals possible. A third example is that assessing prior learning is a matter of individual assessment, even if the prior learning is a result of a collective and probably informal learning process where the individual results are related to a specific context." | GameTime: 118.8504 sec |
