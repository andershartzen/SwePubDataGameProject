Ethnology Meets Game Studies" 3= "The distributive game of school closures"  - Solution = "Agent-Based Simulation of the Trust and Tracing Game for Supply Chains and Networks" - Abstract: "This paper describes a multi-agent simulation model of the Trust And Tracing game. The Trust And Tracing game is a gaming simulation for human players, developed as a research tool for data collection on human behaviour in food supply chains with asymmetric information about food quality and food safety. Important issues in the game are opportunistic behaviour (deceit), trust and institutional arrangements for enforcing compliance. The goal is to improve the understanding of human decision making with respect to these issues. To this end multi-agent simulation can be applied to simulate the effect of models of individual decision making in partner selection, negotiation, deceit and trust on system behaviour. The combination of human gaming simulation and multi-agent simulation offers a basis for model refinement in a cycle of validation, experimentation, and formulation of new hypotheses. This paper describes a first round of model formulation and validation. The models presented are validated by a series of experiments performed by the implemented simulation system, of which the outcomes are compared on aggregated level to the outcomes of games played by humans. The experiments cover in a systematic way the important variations in parameter settings possible in the game and in the characteristics of the agents. The simulation results show the same tendencies of behaviour as the observed human games." | GameTime: 15.02336 sec |

This means others who lack legitimate reasons may then have the opportunity to behave uncooperatively, i.e. free-ride, and be indistinguishable from those with legitimate reasons. Free-riders have a degree of anonymity. In the context of a public good game we consider the e¤ect of free-rider anonymity on the ability of voluntary punishment to sustain cooperative social norms. Despite only inducing a weak form of free-rider anonymity, punishment falls and cannot sustain cooperation." | GameTime: 26.92964 sec |

For instance in food trade, market actors have to rely on their trade partner’s quality statements. The roles of trust and deception in supply networks in various cultural and organisational settings are subject of research in the social sciences. The Trust And Tracing game is an instrument for that type of study. It is a game for human players. Conducting experiments is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, it is hard to formulate hypotheses and to test effects of parameter changes, as this requires many participants. For these reasons the project reported in this paper investigated the feasibility of multi-agent simulation of the game and delivered a prototype. This paper briefly describes the game and introduces the process composition of the agents. The prototype uses simple, but effective models. The paper concludes with directions for refinement of models for agent behaviour." | GameTime: 58.46262 sec |
