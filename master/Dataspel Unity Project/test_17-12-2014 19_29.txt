One cytokine related to HL is interleukin-9 (IL-9) and it is known to affect both mast cells and eosinophils. The aim of this study was to explore if the expression of IL-9 correlates to the presence of these inflammatory cells in HL tumours.METHODS:In 131 HL biopsies, immunostainings for IL-9 and IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) were performed. The same material was previously stained for mast cells and eosinophils. These data were correlated to clinical and survival data from all patients.RESULTS:Fifty-three percent of cases were positive for IL-9 and 19% were positive for IL-9R in the cytoplasm of the tumour cells. The IL-9 positive patients had more eosinophils (P = 0.002) and mast cells (P = 0.02) in their tumours, more often a nodular sclerosis histology (P &lt; 0.0001), a higher white-blood-cell count (P = 0.006) and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.003) at the time of diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS:IL-9 expression is related to the histology, clinical picture and the presence of eosinophils and mast cells in HL. These results indicate that IL-9 is an important part of the cytokine network and inflammatory infiltrate in HL." | GameTime: 7.760721 sec |

Legislation, ordinances and quality assurance systems provide guidelines for implementing sustainable production technologies in horticulture at a higher level. Horticultural research has compiled solutions to improve sustainable production. Despite of regulations, hands-on information, solid scientific data on sustainable strategies for horticulture and a general environmental awareness, there is reluctance in considering sustainable technology and reorganizing horticultural production lines. Knowledge within commercial horticulture is situated knowledge; this means experience consolidated within the branch is a precondition for application. However, knowledge on sustainable technology follows the tradition of natural sciences and technology. Another crucial aspect concerns the path from understanding sustainable technology to putting it into action. Reflection on reflection in action as an activity aims at producing a good verbal description of reflection in action, which can be shared with other people. While reflection in or on action is primarily private the notion of reflection on reflection in action is tied to the fact that learning and experience exchange are social activities that proceed in different communities of practice. Dialogue-inspired methods may act as a tool. In the present paper we discuss the dialogue seminar and Socratic dialog methods to bridge the gap between scientific and technological progress in horticulture and horticultural practice to be employed in horticultural extension." | GameTime: 24.26083 sec |
